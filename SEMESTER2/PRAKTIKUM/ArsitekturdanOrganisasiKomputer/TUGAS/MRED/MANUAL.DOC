                                  Introduction







        Welcome to the wonderful world of Mister ED.  We  at Cornerstone
        Systems  think  that  Mister  ED is the best programmer's editor
        available for the DOS environment.  We would like  to  thank you
        in advance for registering your copy of Mister ED. 


        A Quick Word About This Manual

        This  manual  was not designed to be a comprehensive manual, but
        was designed as a reference tool, and is  in  fact  Mister  ED's
        help reformatted for printing and ease of reference.

                        License Agreement and Disclaimer





                               LICENSE AGREEMENT

        but is being distributed as "Shareware". 

        Non-registered  users  of  this  software  are granted a limited

        discontinue using Mister ED. 

        What does this all mean?  If you regularly use Mister ED -- i.e.

        your copy.  That way Cornerstone Systems will be able to stay in
        business and continue providing you with support. 

        A  Mister  ED  registration  entitles  any number of people (and
        computers) to have access and use of the software, but only  one
        at  a  time.  The software may be freely moved from one location
        to another so long as it is not being  used  on  more  than  one
        computer at a time. 

        All  users  are granted a limited license to copy Mister ED only
        for  the  trial  use  of  others  and  subject  to   the   above
        limitations.    This  license  does  NOT include distribution or
        copying of this software package:

             3) For any consideration or 'disk fee'.
             4) Distribution in modified form, i.e. the file containing
                this license information MUST be included, along with
                the full Mister ED documentation.

                              System Requirements


        To use Mister ED, you must have, at least, the following: 


              1) An IBM PC, XT, or AT (or close compatible). 

              2) PC-DOS or MS-DOS 2.0 or greater. 

              3) One disk drive. 

              4) Either a color or monochrome monitor with an  80-column
                 display.  

              5) 256 KB of available memory (although Mister ED will use
                 up to 640 KB if it is available). 

              6) ED.EXE, the  editor  itself.    No  other  programs are
                 required to operate Mister ED. 

              7) A statement in your CONFIG.SYS file allowing  at  least
                 20 files to be open.  Like this:  FILES=20

              8) Although  not   required,   including   an   additional
                 statement  in your CONFIG.SYS file allotting 10 or more
                 buffers is a good idea.  Like this:  BUFFERS=10

                                 Files Supplied


        Mister ED is supplied on  a  single  360  KB  diskette  (3  1/2"
        diskettes  are  available on special request).  As always, it is
        wise to make backups of those programs you value.  Two files are
        distributed on the Mister ED diskette: 

           INSTALL.EXE - A self un-archiving file that contains Mister
                         ED, a manual, and several utility programs.  It
                         un-archives to the current directory.

           READ.ME     - A text file, which includes an explanation of
                         what is in INSTALL.EXE and any late breaking
                         news on Mister ED.


        You will find the following files  in  the  INSTALL.EXE  archive
        file: 


           DETAB.DOC   - File explaining the DETAB.EXE utility.

           DETAB.EXE   - A utility that strips tab characters from a
                         file and replaces them with spaces.

           ED.EXE      - The one!  The only!  The world's best editor
                         -- Mister ED!  (Applause)

           MANUAL.EXE  - A utility program that will print out Mister
                         ED's manual.

           MR_ED.HLP   - Mister ED's help file.  Access it through
                         Mister ED.

           PURGE.COM   - A powerful utility to delete files and
                         subdirectories.

           RELEASE.DOC - A document explaining differences and
                         improvements in Mister ED's last several
                         versions.

           SAMPLE.LST  - A sample file list for your perusal.

        Manual.Exe

        If you have difficulty reading the text displayed by MANUAL.EXE,
        it  has  an optional command-line parameter to force it to use a
        black-and-white color palette: 

             MANUAL /b            Forces MANUAL into BW80 mode

        You may need to specify the /B parameter if you are using an LCD
        screen or a system that has  a  color  graphics  adapter  and  a
        monochrome or composite monitor.

                                    Features




        Mister  ED  is  an  advanced  editor  specifically  designed for
        program development.  Some of its features include: 

                - Blazing speed.
                - Powerful functions, yet easy to learn.
                - Advanced search capabilities.
                - Large capacity.  Edits files up to 32 megabytes.
                - Highly configurable.
                - Context sensitive help.
                - Full menu system.
                - Optional pulldown menus.
                - Language sensitive features.

        Its unique advantage is that it is tailored for  large  projects
        with multiple files in multiple directories. 


                - Speed.  No existing  editor  can  beat  Mister  ED for
                  speed  of  searching, cursor movement, and file access
                  (loading and saving).  Special effort was made to make
                  the commands you use most the fastest possible.   Most
                  programming   editors   on   the   market   today  are
                  interpreters,  which  makes  them  run   slower   than
                  non-interpreters.   Mister ED is not an interpreter so
                  it will be naturally  faster  than  other  editors  in
                  virtually all commands. 

                - Disk Based.  You are not limited  by  memory,  only by
                  DOS.  This means you can edit 32-megabyte files.  Huge
                  programs  and  data  files  are now common.  Mister ED
                  allows editing of files as large as DOS allows and  as
                  easily as editing small files. 

                - Virtual Memory.  No  special  commands  are  needed to
                  buffer  sections  of  your  file  in  and out to disk,
                  Mister ED  takes  care  of  this  automatically.   And
                  Mister ED uses all of memory too. 

                - Easy To Learn.  No control Q-X commands to  learn here
                  -- in Mister ED press one key and a menu  will pop up.
                  The menus clearly label the options so you do not have
                  to remember, "now is that the "I" or "G" option that I
                  want  to use?".  But best of all, most of the time the
                  defaults are just what the doctor ordered and all  you
                  have to do is press return to continue. 

                - Powerful.  Being easy to learn does not  hinder Mister
                  ED's  power.  Mister ED contains the powerful features
                  a professional programmer frequently uses,  with  even
                  more being added. 



                                     Page 9





                - Mature.  Mister ED is being used by two of the  top 10
                  software  development  companies  --  one  since 1985.
                  This means that Mister ED has been improved on like  a
                  fine wine. 

                - Highly Configurable.   If  you  do  not  like  the way
                  Mister ED is configured, change it to the way you like
                  it.  With more than 50 configuration options, there is
                  something  right for you.  This configurability allows
                  you to set up token match for languages we have  never
                  dreamed of before. 

                - Small Footprint.  The only file required to run Mister
                  ED  is  ED.EXE.    This  means  it  boots faster -- no
                  searching for 35 support files.   As  a  consultant it
                  means  you  can  take it with you on a floppy when you
                  visit your clients, so no more EDLIN! 

                - Bidirectional Search.  Searching backward  as  well as
                  forward  is  just  one  of the many search and replace
                  options supported by Mister ED.   In  addition  it has
                  query  replace  (also  bidirectional),  case sensitive
                  search, and block replace.  Block  replace  allows the
                  replacement to be limited to a marked block instead of
                  a full file. 

                - File Lists.  The most advanced feature in Mister ED is
                  its ability to handle large lists of files in multiple
                  directories.  This allows the programmer to create and
                  maintain  a  list  of  all  files contained in his/her
                  project.  With this list,  editing  and search/replace
                  can  take  place  on  the  project  level not just the
                  single file level. 

                - Extensive Block Operations.  Very few editors give you
                  as many options  after  you  have  selected  a  block,
                  regardless  of  how  you selected the block.  With the
                  stream and column block support  you  can  Cut,  Copy,
                  Paste,   Kill,   Save,   Print,  Change  Case,  Adjust
                  Horizontally, Format a Paragraph and Spell Check.   In
                  a  world where what you can do is often limited by how
                  you arrive there, Mister ED gives you a  full  set  of
                  choices regardless of the path you took to get there.

                                  Quick Start


        This  section  contains  a brief description of Mister ED's most
        basic commands for those of you who need to be up and running on
        Mister ED quickly.  The three most important topics  are covered
        here: 

                 1)  How to Load and Save files.
                 2)  How to Quit Mister ED.
                 3)  How to get Help.


        If   you  haven't  unarchived  the  Mister  ED  files  from  the
        INSTALL.EXE program, you need to  do  that  now.    Move  to the
        directory  where  you  want  Mister  ED  and, with the Mister ED
        diskette in drive A, type A:INSTALL.  All of the Mister ED files
        will be unarchived into the current directory. 

        To activate Mister ED from the operating system, just type "ED".
        By specifying up to nine file names on the command line,  Mister
        ED  will  load these files into separate windows.  Additionally,
        you can specify search patterns or line numbers  for  each file.
        The syntax is as follows: 

        ED [filename_1 [### or "search pattern"]]..[file_9 [### or ""]]

        where ### is any any line number to move to, optionally followed
        by a comma and a column number (eg.  32,15 = line 32 column 15).
        And  "search pattern" is any pattern to search for -- it must be
        quoted.  Up to nine files and patterns or  line  numbers  can be
        specified. 

        To  load  a  file, press <Esc> to call up the Pulldown Menus and
        select Load in the File Menu. 

        To save a file, press <Esc> to call up the  Pulldown  Menus  and
        select Save in the File Menu. 

        To  leave  Mister  ED, press <Esc> to call up the Pulldown Menus
        and select Quit in the File Menu.  You can also press <Q> at the
        main Pulldown Menu with the same result.    Selecting  Update in
        the  File  Menu  will save your file before dropping the current
        window (and quitting if it is the only window open).  Update can
        also be accessed at the main Pulldown Menu. 

        HELP! is just a key away.  Press <Shift F1>  to  receive context
        sensitive help.  Press it again and you will get the Help Index.

        To  get  Mister ED's Pulldown Menus for access to more of Mister
        ED's commands, or to get out of a sticky  situation,  press  the
        <Esc>  key.  The <Esc> key can get you out of almost any command
        unscathed.  Use <Esc> to view and activate commands via Pulldown
        Menus. 

        You can configure Mister ED through the  Environment,  which  is
        accessed through the Layout pulldown menu.

                             COMMAND MODE COMMANDS


             To initiate a command when using Command  Mode,  press  its
        first letter.  To access Command Mode, press the <Esc> key.  You
        can  switch between the Pulldown Menus and Command Mode from the
        Environment Menu, located within the Layout menu or by selecting
        <E> at the Command Mode prompt.  Listed  below  are  all  of the
        commands that are active in Command Mode. 


        A - Append  is  used  to  append  a  file  after any line in the
            current window.  You specify the file and the line number. 

        B - Browse searches a list of files  with  one  or  more  search
            patterns.    Whenever  a  search  pattern is found, the line
            containing the pattern and the specified number  of  context
            lines  before  and after it will be displayed.  You have the
            option to send the output to the screen only or to both  the
            screen  and the current window.  You also have the option to
            create a file list.  A file list is  a  file  which contains
            the  names  of all the files with at least one occurrence of
            the search pattern or patterns. 

        C - OS Command allows you to execute an operating system command
            from within Mr. ED.    You  can  direct  the  output  to the
            current window or the operating system screen.  This command
            is ideal for compiling. 

        D - Drop  allows  you  to  drop  one  or  more windows.  You are
            prompted for the window number to remove.   The  windows are
            numbered  from 1 to 9, and the window number is indicated in
            the left most portion of that window's status line.  To drop
            multiple windows just separate the  window  numbers  with  a
            comma or dash.  For example, "1,3-5" will drop windows 1 and
            3 through 5.  If any of the files to  be  dropped  have been
            modified and are not saved, you will have the opportunity to
            save them. 

        E - Environment  is  used  to  configure the various environment
            parameters for Mr.  ED.    Options  include  the  ability to
            create  a  backup  file every time a file is saved, suppress
            tab compression, paragraph margins, etc.

        G - Goto moves the cursor from the current window to the  window
            specified by you at the Goto prompt.  This is similar to the
            <Alt  0>  window command except Goto is invoked from command
            mode. 

        I - Insert allows you to insert additional windows into  Mr. ED.
            There  can  be  a  maximum of nine windows.  Each window can
            have a different file or file list. 






                                    Page 16





        L - Load is used to load a file into the  current  window.   The
            maximum size of a file that can be loaded is 64,000 lines. 

        M - Multi-View  allows  you  to look at, and work with, the same
            file from two or more windows.  Making changes in one window
            will change the file in all other Multi-Viewed windows.   To
            use Multi-View you must have at least two windows open.  You
            will be prompted for the window number you wish view from an
            additional  window.  If there is only one other window open,
            the assumption is made you wish a second view of that  other
            window. 

        N - New  clears  the  file from the current window.  If the file
            has been modified since it was last saved, you are asked  if
            you really wish to do this. 

        O - OS Shell allows you to invoke an occurrence of the operating
            system.   This allows you to perform all of the DOS commands
            (copy files, play games, etc.) and still remain  in  Mr. ED.
            When  you  wish  to  return  to Mr. ED simply enter the EXIT
            command in response to the DOS prompt. 

        P - Print is used when you wish to print the entire  file.   You
            can print portions of your file using Select ( <Ctrl S> ) or
            Block ( <Ctrl B> ) modes. 

        Q - Quit  exits  Mr.  ED.  If you have modified a file in one of
            the windows, you are shown a  list  of  modified  files  and
            prompted to see if you really wish to exit. 

        R - Rename is used to change the default file name.  The default
            file  name  is  the  file  name  displayed in the right hand
            portion of the status line and is used as the  default  when
            saving  the  file.  Only the file name in Mr. ED is changed;
            the file on disk still has the original name. 

        S - Save is used to save the file on disk.    This  command will
            ask  you  for  the name of the file to save.  If you wish to
            save the file to the default file  name  then  simply  press
            <Enter>, otherwise enter a new file name. 

        U - Update  is  similar to the Save command except that it exits
            the current window in addition to saving the file.  If there
            is only one window in use, then after the file is saved  you
            will be returned to DOS.  Otherwise, the current window will
            be  dropped  and  the  you will be positioned in an adjacent
            window. 

        T - Toggle  Modify  allows  you  to  make  a   file   that   was
            "Modifiable",  unmodifiable  and  vice versa.  If you make a
            file unmodifiable, the file can not be altered  in  any way.
            This  is  great for version control systems, and other times
            when you want to  keep  a  file  from  accidentally  getting
            changed.

                            ENTERING DATA AT PROMPTS

             Whenever you are prompted for data for a command (e.g. file
        name, search pattern) the following conventions apply: 

        1.  You can press <Enter>  or  <Tab>  to  advance  to  the  next
            prompt.    If  you  are at the last prompt and press <Enter>
            then the command will be initiated.  If you press  <Tab> the
            cursor will wrap to the first prompt. 

        2.  You can press <Shift Tab> to back up to the previous prompt.
            If  you are at the first prompt then the cursor will wrap to
            the last prompt. 

        3.  You can use <Up> and <Dn> to arrow through the prompt lines. 

        4.  You  can  press  <Ctrl  Enter>  to  initiate  the   command,
            providing  the  data  is valid for all of the prompts.  This
            can be useful if the command has multiple prompts and all of
            the defaults are correct. 

        5.  Most of the editing commands that work in "screen mode" also
            apply to the  prompts.    For  example:    left arrow, right
            arrow,  delete  to end of line, delete to beginning of line,
            paste selected text (providing it contains a line's worth or
            less), undo line/word delete, all work with the prompts. 

        6.  You can use the <+> and <-> keys to  increase  and  decrease
            numerical prompts.

                                 HELPFUL HINTS


        Invoking - When  you execute Mr. ED from DOS you can specify the
        Mr. ED     name of up to nine files you wish to load.  Each file
                   will be loaded into its own window.  For  example, to
                   execute  Mr.  ED  and load two source files you could
                   type "ED source.pas  data.asm".    Wildcards  ("*" or
                   "?")   are   also   valid  in  filenames.    For more
                   information about  valid  filenames  please  see  the
                   "Load Command" or "File Lists" help. 

                   Additionally, you can specify search patterns or line
                   numbers for each file.  The syntax is as follows: 

                   ED [filename_1 [r+] [### or "search pattern"]]...
                           [filename_9 [r+] [### or 'search pattern']]

                   where  ###  is  any  any  line  number  to  move  to,
                   optionally followed by a comma and  a  column  number
                   (eg.    32,15  =  line  32  column  15).  And "search
                   pattern" is any pattern to search for -- it  must  be
                   quoted.    The  line  number  parameter  can  be very
                   useful, since most compilers display the line numbers
                   of erroneous source statements. 

                   If "r+" is found as the  first  parameter  after  the
                   filename then that file will not be "Modifiable".  In
                   other words, it will be loaded as a read-only file. 

        Select   - To  select  complete lines of text (a stream of text,
        Text       so to speak), move the cursor to the beginning of the
                   text area you wish to select and press <Ctrl S>.  Now
                   you can  use  most  of  the  normal  cursor  movement
                   commands,  such  as  arrow and page keys, search, and
                   goto marker,  to  select  text.    Moving  the cursor
                   highlights  the  selected  text.   After your desired
                   text has been highlighted, press <Ctrl S> to view the
                   Select Text command options.    To  invoke  a command
                   simply   enter  the  character  affiliated  with  the
                   command.  There are commands to copy  to  memory (the
                   "select  buffer"),  save to a file, print, adjust the
                   indentation, etc. If you copy the text to memory, use
                   the "paste select buffer" command ( <F2> ) to  insert
                   or  overlay  the text at the cursor.  If you know the
                   command you wish to invoke, you can save  a  step  by
                   omitting  to  press  <Ctrl S> after your desired text
                   has been highlighted. 

        Block    - Selecting a block of text is similar to  selecting  a
        Text       "stream"  of  text,  except  you  press <Ctrl B> (for
                   block)  instead  of  <Ctrl  S>.    The  commands that
                   pertain  to  block  mode  are  the same as those that
                   pertain to select mode.    Block  mode  is  ideal for
                   column manipulation.

        Undo     - You  can  use the <F1> key to "undo" the last line or
        Delete     word  deleted.    This   can   be   very   useful for
                   replicating  text  or  for  correcting  an  erroneous
                   delete.  The "undo key" works  with  the  delete line
                   key  <F8>,  the  delete  word key <F7>, the delete to
                   beginning of line key <F5>, and the delete to end  of
                   line key <F6>. 

                 - You can use the <F2> key to "paste" any text that was
                   selected  in  either  "select"  or  "block" mode.  To
                   "paste" the selected text simply move the  cursor  to
                   the desired location and press <F2>.  If the text was
                   selected  in  "select mode" then the "stream of text"
                   will be inserted (or overlaid) at the cursor.  If the
                   text was selected in  "block  mode"  then  the  upper
                   left-hand  corner  of the "rectangle of text" will be
                   "pasted" at the  cursor.    Remember  if  you  are in
                   "Overlay", you will overwrite any text already at the
                   "paste" position. 

        Undo     - By  pressing  <Ctrl U>, you can restore a line to its
        Changes    original, unmodified condition.   Be  Careful:  <Ctrl
                   U>  will  not work if you have moved off the line you
                   wish to unmodify. 

        Markers  - Markers  are  used  to  remember  a  specific  cursor
                   location.    This  can  be very useful if you wish to
                   look around elsewhere in the file and later return to
                   your original location.    You  can  set  up  to four
                   different   "markers".      This  is  accomplished by
                   pressing  <Shift  F8>  to  invoke  the  "set   marker
                   command"  and,  in response to the prompt, specifying
                   the letter (A-D) of the marker you wish to  set.   To
                   return  to  a marker, simply press the <Shift F7> key
                   to invoke the "goto line" command and, in response to
                   the prompt, enter the letter (A-D) of the marker that
                   you wish to go to. 

        Full     - When you are working with more than  one  window  you
         Screen    can  either  "split" the screen display vertically or
          versus   horizontally to accommodate the  various  windows  or
        Split      use  the  "full"  screen for each one of the windows.
         Screen    The default display for multiple windows  is  set  in
                   the  Environment  Menu.  You can use the <Ctrl N> key
                   to  toggle  between  the  three   modes   of display.
                   Pressing  <Ctrl  Z> while in split screen will "zoom"
                   the current window to full screen.  Pressing <Ctrl Z>
                   again will put you back in the original split  screen
                   mode.    When in split screen mode, use <Ctrl Up> and
                   <Ctrl Dn> to change the size of the current window.

        Foreign  - You can  enter  any  character  in  the  extended  or
        Chars.     control character sets by entering Extended Character
                   Mode.    To enter Extended Character Mode press <Ctrl
                   E>.  To enter control characters once in the Extended
                   Character Mode, press the <Ctrl> key  in  combination
                   with  the  desired character, or if only entering one
                   control character,  simply  press  the  corresponding
                   alphabetic  key  (e.g.  press  "a" for <Ctrl A>).  To
                   enter the extended characters use the  <Alt>  key  in
                   conjunction   with  the  keypad.    To  exit Extended
                   Character Mode press <Ctrl Break>.  Refer to an ASCII
                   or extended character table to determine the  control
                   or  extended  character  you wish to enter.  To enter
                   more than  one  foreign  character,  set  the  repeat
                   factor before entering Extended Character Mode. 

        Special  - This  command  is  unique  to  Mr. ED.  It aligns the
        Tabbing    cursor with the beginning of the  next  word  on  the
                   previous  line.  This command can be very useful when
                   entering columns of data  or  for  aligning  assembly
                   language  statements.    To invoke this command press
                   <Alt Tab>. 

        Repeat   - Most commands (search, down arrow, etc.)  in  Mr.  ED
        Factor     can  be  executed  a  multiple  number  of times.  To
                   execute a command more than once all you need  to  do
                   is  to  set the "repeat factor".  Do this by pressing
                   <Ctrl R> and then entering the number for the  amount
                   of  times you wish to execute the command.  After you
                   set the repeat factor, the next command entered  will
                   be  executed  that  many times.  For example, a quick
                   way to enter 50 asterisks would be to press <Ctrl R>,
                   enter the number "50", press <Enter>, and then  enter
                   the "*" character.

                                 PULLDOWN MENUS

             When  using  Pulldown  Menus,  use the left and right arrow
        keys to move to the menu you wish to enter and press <Enter>, or
        just press the first letter of the menu  name.    To  access the
        Pulldown  Menus,  press the <Esc> key.  When inside a menu, move
        the highlight bar to the command you wish  to  execute  and  hit
        <Enter>,  or  press the first letter of the command, and it will
        be executed.  Switch between the Pulldown Menus and  the Command
        Mode  from the Environment Menu, located within the Layout menu.
        In addition to the menus listed, two other  commands,  Quit  and
        Update, can be accessed by pressing their first letter. 


        File    - The  File  menu contains file related commands.  These
                  commands include loading and saving  files,  operating
                  system commands, printing, and quitting Mr. ED. 

        Window  - Window  commands such as inserting, dropping, changing
                  the style,  and  moving  between  them,  are  accessed
                  through this appropriately named menu. 

        Search  - Looking  for  love?    Use the Search menu and you can
                  find love, Love, or even LOVE.  If you choose, you can
                  replace love with other words using Replace. 

        Modes   - The Modes menu  contains  several  of  Mr.  ED's  most
                  powerful  and  useful features, including select/block
                  text, compare mode,  condensed  mode,  access  to  the
                  ASCII extended character set, and file select mode. 

        Editing - The  Editing  menu  lets  you insert and delete lines,
                  words, and portions  of  lines.    You  can  also move
                  lines,  words,  and portions of lines by deleting then
                  pasting your lines or words. 

        Goto    - Commands on the Goto menu allow movement of the cursor
                  around the current line, screen, and entire file. 

        Screen  - The Screen menu allows movement of your file  relative
                  to  the  screen.    You can scroll it left, right, up,
                  down,  or  center  the  current  line  vertically   or
                  horizontally on the screen. 

        Layout  - Through  the  Layout  menu, you can access commands to
                  toggle the Word Wrap  and  Auto  Indent  features,  to
                  format the current paragraph, and to set the multitude
                  of configurable Environment options. 

        Other   - The  Other menu contains additional commands including
                  access  to  Macros,  remarking  the  previous   block,
                  setting  the  repeat factor, and switching the case of
                  letters.

        The following two commands, like the menu names, are hot --  you
        can  access  them  from the main pulldown menu by pressing their
        first letter.  However, these two  commands  are  commands; they
        are  not  pulldown menus and are not listed on the main pulldown
        menu. 


        Quit    - Quit exits Mr. ED.  If you have modified a file in one
                  of the windows, you are shown a list of modified files
                  and prompted to see if you really wish to exit. 

        Update  - Update is similar to the Save command except  that  it
                  exits  the  current  window  in addition to saving the
                  file.  If there is only one window in use,  then after
                  the  file  is  saved  you  will  be  returned  to DOS.
                  Otherwise, the current window will be dropped and  the
                  you will be positioned in an adjacent window.

                           Append to Buffer Commands


             After  selecting  text  in  Select  or Block Modes, you can
        decide to  Append  to  Buffer.    That  is,  you  can  stick the
        currently  selected  text  at the end of any text already in the
        computer's memory (the buffer).  A copy of the text stays in the
        buffer until you put new text in it (using something other  than
        Append).    Once  text  is copied to the buffer, you can use the
        <F2> key to paste it.  Sorry, but you cannot  append  Blocked or
        Selected   text  of  differing  widths  to  each  other.   After
        selecting <+> at the Select or Block Mode prompt to  append  the
        text to the buffer, you will be shown an additional prompt where
        the following commands are available: 

        C - To append a copy of the text to the buffer, use Copy. 

        D - To  append  a  copy of the text to the buffer while deleting
            the text from the file, use Delete + Copy. 

        K - Delete  +  No  Copy  (or  Kill)  deletes  the  text  without
            appending  it  to  the buffer.  This is very convenient when
            you wish to delete  several  lines  but  also  preserve  the
            contents of the buffer. 

        + - No Append will return you to the Select or Block Mode prompt
            without appending the text to the buffer.

                                 Append Command




             Append is used to append another file after any line in the
        current window.  Mr. ED will default to the current line number,
        but  you  can easily change it to a different line number or any
        marker you have set.  Just  press  <Tab>  to  move  to  the line
        number  prompt  and  enter  the line number or the letter of the
        marker after which you wish to append the additional  file.   At
        the  file  name  prompt, you can press <Ctrl G> to select from a
        list of files you have previously loaded (if you  wish  to  load
        one  aGain),  or,  if  you  are using a file list, you can press
        <Shift F2> to select a file to append from the  file  list.   In
        addition, at a blank file name prompt, you can press <Enter> and
        Mr.  ED  will  show  you  a  list  of  the  files in the current
        directory, or in a specific directory if you specified a path at
        the "blank" file name prompt.

                                   Block Mode

             Block Mode allows you to select and work with a rectangular
        block of text.  Enter Block Mode by pressing <Ctrl B>.  The text
        you block out becomes highlighted as you work.    One  corner of
        the  block is anchored at the place you originally pressed <Ctrl
        B> (see <Ctrl J> below on how to change  that).    The following
        commands are active within Block Mode: 




        Command                     Description
        Lft,Rgt,Up,Dn    Move cursor and highlight more text.
        PgUp,PgDn        Move cursor and highlight one page up or down.
        Home,End         Highlight to beginning or end of row.
        Ctrl Home/End    Highlight to beginning or end of the file.
        Ctrl B           End blocking of text and view Block Mode commands.
        Ctrl C           Use Condensed Mode to move cursor and highlight.
        Ctrl F           Highlight to beginning of first word on line.
        Ctrl J           Jump to opposite corner of highlighted text.
        Ctrl R           Use repeat factor for Search or movement.
        Ctrl T           Use Token Match to move cursor and highlight.
        Shift F7         Highlight to specific line number or marker.
        F9,F10           Highlight backward or forward to Search Pattern.
        Shift F9/F10     Search and Replace within highlighted text.
        A,C,D,F,K,L,M,
          P,S,or +       Execute specific Block Mode command.

                              Block Mode Commands

        A - Adjust  modifies  the  indentation of the blocked text.  The
            indentation is adjusted by using the arrow keys.    The left
            arrow  key  moves  the  block  one space to the left and the
            right arrow key moves the block one space to the right.   Or
            press <L> for left justification. 

        C - Copy is used to copy the block to the "select buffer".  Once
            the block is copied you can use the <F2> key to paste it.  A
            copy of the block stays in the "select buffer" until you put
            a  new block in it.  This means you can insert the same text
            multiple times using <F2>. 

        D - Delete  +  Copy  is  used  to   delete   the   block   while
            simultaneously  copying  it  to  the  "select  buffer".  The
            manner in which the block is deleted depends on whether  the
            user  is  in  Insert  or  Overlay Mode.  If the window is in
            Insert Mode  then  the  block  will  be  "deleted"  and  any
            characters  to  the right of the block will be shifted left,
            otherwise the block will be "erased", and text to the  right
            of  the block will be unaffected.  Once the block is deleted
            you can use the <F2>  key  to  paste  it.    The  Insert and
            Overlay  Modes have similar effects on pasting as they do on
            deleting. 

        F - File List turns your list of files into a "file  list".   It
            is  assumed  that  the  text  lines  that  have been blocked
            consist of a valid path name (optional) and a list of  valid
            file  names  or  file  masks.   After the new "file list" is
            constructed, Mr. ED will attempt to load the first  file  in
            the list. 

        K - Delete  + No Copy (or Kill) deletes the blocked text without
            copying it to the "select buffer".  The manner in  which the
            block is deleted depends on whether the user (that's you) is
            in Insert Mode or Overlay Mode.  This is convenient when you
            wish to delete a block but also preserve the contents of the
            "select buffer". 

        L - Lightning Spell Check allows you to use Borland Inc.'s Turbo
            Lightning  Spell  Checker on the blocked text.  Before using
            Lightning Spell Check, Turbo Lightning must be activated  by
            being  loaded  into  memory.    (Actually,  it must first be
            purchased from Borland.) DO NOT LOAD  TURBO  LIGHTNING  FROM
            WITHIN  MR.  ED  (using  OS  Shell  or  OS  Command).  Turbo
            Lightning  is  memory  resident;  memory  resident  programs
            loaded  into  memory  while within another program can cause
            unexpected results, like the inability to  save  your files.
            When  loaded  properly, Turbo Lightning acts just like it is
            part of Mr. ED.  Turbo Lightning  is  copyright  (C) Borland
            Inc., Scotts Valley, California.

        M - Modify  allows  you to modify the text within the block.  At
            the Modify prompt, you can select options to fill the  block
            with  a  character,  convert  all of the characters to lower
            case, convert all of the characters to  upper  case,  or  to
            switch the case of all of the characters. 

        P - Print  allows you to print the blocked text.  The block will
            be  "printed  to"  the  device  that  is  specified  in  the
            Environment Menu.  For one printing you can change the print
            device  from  within this command.  You can also specify the
            printer left margin and page size in the Environment Menu. 

        S - Save File is used to save the blocked text to a file. 

        + - Append to buffer allows you to add the blocked text  to  the
            end  of  the "select buffer".  There is an additional prompt
            for the Append command where you can append a  copy  of  the
            text  to  the buffer, delete the text plus append it, delete
            the text without appending it, or turn off  the  append  and
            return  to  the  Block  Mode  prompt.   Be forewarned:  this
            command will not append texts of differing widths.

                                 Browse Command


             The Browse Command is used to search a list  of  files  for
        one  or  more  search  patterns.    Whenever a search pattern is
        found, the line containing the pattern and the specified  number
        of  context  lines  before  and after it will be displayed.  You
        have the option of creating a file list  instead  of  displaying
        the lines found.  A file list is a file which contains the names
        of  other  files.   A file list created with Browse contains the
        names of all the files with  at  least  one  occurrence  of  the
        search  pattern  or  patterns.   You have the option to send the
        output to the screen only or to both the screen and the  current
        window. 


        Case       - The Case flag specifies whether or not to perform a
                     case  sensitive  search.  Set this prompt to "N" to
                     perform a case insensitive search.    That  is, the
                     alphabetic  characters  in  the search pattern will
                     match both their upper and lower  case equivalents.
                     For  example,  the  search pattern "the" will match
                     "the", "The", "THE", etc., when the Case prompt  is
                     set to "N". 

        Token      - The  token flag indicates whether or not the search
                     pattern must be a token.  A token simply means that
                     when the pattern is found, it cannot have any other
                     alphanumeric characters next to it.    For example,
                     if  the  "token"  field  is  "Y",  then  the search
                     pattern "th" would match  "th"  but  it  would  not
                     match  "the", "that", "th1", etc. This flag is very
                     useful  when  searching  for  variables  in  source
                     files. 

        Expression - To  use  regular expressions in the Search Pattern,
                     set this prompt to "Y".  Regular expressions  are a
                     set  of  commands that give you more versatility in
                     your Search Patterns.  For example, if you  wish to
                     search  for  several  different  words contained in
                     different sets of brackets, you could use "{*}"  as
                     the   Search   Pattern.      Refer  to  the regular
                     expressions help for complete rules. 

        Search     - The Search Pattern is simply what you  are  looking
        Pattern(s)   for.    To  search for more than one pattern simply
                     separate each pattern with the "|" character.   For
                     example,  to  search  for the words "procedure" and
                     "function" simply enter "procedure|function".   You
                     can  search for a maximum of 10 different patterns.
                     Remember the  case,  token,  and  expression  flags
                     apply to all of the search patterns.

        File(s) to - Files to search are the files within which you wish
        Search       to look for the search pattern.  You can specify an
                     individual  file  name  or  a  "mask"  (e.g. *.PAS,
                     JON.*).  You can also specify a file which contains
                     the names of other files to be searched, creatively
                     called a File List, by preceding the file name with
                     the "@" character (e.g. @JON.LST).  You can include
                     more than one name or mask by separating them  with
                     the  "|" character (e.g. *.ASM|JN.C).  In addition,
                     when working with a "mask" such as *.PAS,  you  can
                     specify  files  to skip by proceeding the file name
                     with   the    "!"    character.        For example,
                     *.PAS|*.C|!JN.PAS  would  cause all of the files in
                     the current directory with PAS and C extensions  to
                     be  searched  except  the file JN.PAS.  The "|" and
                     "!" characters do not work with file lists, but you
                     can include the "!" character within the list.  For
                     example, @SLST|!HLP.ASC  and  CIG.C|@FMT  will  not
                     work  --  note  the  File  List  in each (@SLST and
                     @FMT). 

        Number of  - This is number of lines prior to the search pattern
        Backward     to display, in addition to the line with the search
        Lines        pattern.  If you do not wish to  display  any prior
                     lines then enter a value of 0.  

        Number of  - This is number of lines after the search pattern to
        Forward      display  in  addition  to  the line with the search
        Lines        pattern   and   any   backward   (previous)   lines
                     requested.    If  you  do  not  wish to display any
                     successive lines then enter a value of 0. 

        Pause      - If you select Yes, that is to  pause  each  time  a
        after each   search pattern is found, then the display will stop
        pattern      until  you hit the spacebar.  Otherwise, the output
        found (Y/N)  will scroll by faster than you can read it  if  the
                     screen  fills up more than once with text.  Letting
                     the display scroll quickly probably will not matter
                     if you are echoing the lines to the current window,
                     but if you are only viewing the lines as  they  are
                     found  then  you  will  want  to  pause each time a
                     pattern is found. 

        Echo Lines - If you select Yes, then  each  time  a  pattern  is
        Found to     found  it,  and  the  forward  and  backward  lines
        the Current  selected, will be  pasted  into  the  file  in  the
        Window       current  window  in  addition to being shown on the
        (Y/N)        screen.  If you select No, then the  lines  will be
                     shown  on  the screen only.  If you have elected to
                     create a file list then the  lines  echoed  to  the
                     current window as well as those shown on the screen
                     will just be the list of files in which the pattern
                     was found.

        Create a   - This  flag  is  used  to create a list of the files
        File List    which contain the the search pattern.  This list of
        in the       files is then placed in another file called a  File
        Current      List.    When  this  file is being constructed, the
        Window       output to the screen is just the names of the files
        (Y/N)        that are being searched.  If  you  select  Create a
                     File  List,  the  lines found will automatically be
                     echoed to the current window.   This  will  put the
                     file list in the current window. 


        Note:        Remember you can always press <Ctrl Enter> to start
                     the  search  instead of repeatedly pressing <Enter>
                     to skip through all of the fields.

                                  Compare Mode

             Compare Mode performs a comparison of the files in  all  of
        the  open  windows.    Place the cursor on the line in each file
        where you wish to begin the comparison, press <Ctrl K> or select
        Kompare Mode in the pulldown menus, and Mr. ED will perform  the
        comparison,  highlighting  the current line in each window as it
        goes.  Mr. ED will stop at the first set of  lines  that  do not
        compare  exactly.   When in Compare Mode, the following commands
        are available. 




        Command                         Description
        PgUp,PgDn,Up,Dn     Move the highlight bar in the current window.
        Ctrl PgUp/PgDn      Change the current window.
        Enter               Begin the comparison.
        Ctrl Enter          Move the highlight bars down one row and restart
                                comparison.
        Ctrl S              Find the same line in the other window(s).
        Ctrl L              Link the windows together to move highlight bars
                                or to next or previous file simultaneously.
        Ctrl K              Leave Compare Mode.
        Escape              Leave Compare Mode.
        Ctrl +/-            Load the next or previous file in the file list.




             If you only have one window open, Mr. ED will give you  the
        highlight  bar  to use, but you can't do no comparing 'cause you
        ain't got nothin' to compare.

                               Dropping a Window



             Drop allows you to drop one or more windows  (files).   The
        windows  are  numbered  from  1  to  9, and the window number is
        indicated in the left most portion of that window's status line.
        To drop a window just enter that window's number at  the prompt.
        To drop multiple windows just separate the window numbers with a
        comma  or  dash.  For example, "1,3-5" will drop windows 1 and 3
        through 5.  If no window is specified at the prompt, the current
        window will be dropped.  If any of the files in  the  windows to
        be  dropped have been modified and are unsaved, a window showing
        the filenames and which files have been  modified  will  appear,
        giving you the opportunity to save them. 

             If  you  drop all of the open windows, you will Quit Mr. ED
        if the files are unmodified, or if any of the  files  have  been
        modified you will be asked if you really wish to Quit. 

             Drop  is  accessed  from the Command Mode prompt or through
        the Window pulldown menu.

                                  Editing Menu

        Paste Last - Paste Last Delete inserts at  the  cursor  whatever
        Delete       you  last deleted.  This command will paste Deletes
                     made with Start of Line Delete (  <F5>  ),  End  of
                     Line  Delete  (  <F6>  ), Word Delete ( <F7> ), and
                     Line Delete ( <F8> ).  You can paste the  same Last
                     Delete more than once.  This command is very useful
                     for  moving  lines or words, or for repeating lines
                     or words.  Paste Last Delete can  also  be accessed

                     Delete or press <F1> to put the word and space back
                     in at the cursor position. 

        Line       - To delete the current line, select Line  Delete  or
        Delete       press <F8>.  Select Paste Last Delete or press <F1>
                     to  paste  the last line deleted before the current

                              Environment Command


             The  Environment  Command  is used to configure the various
        environment parameters for Mr. ED.  Options include  the ability
        to create backup files, suppress tab compression, enable/disable
        pulldown menus, define token match rules, and other defaults for
        Mr. ED. 


        Paragraph  - Use  Paragraph Indent to set the indentation of the
        Indent       first line of your paragraph relative to  the  left
                     margin.    A  negative  number means the first line
                     will stick out to the left  of  the  rest  of  your
                     paragraph  by  that  number  of spaces.  If you use
                     negative indentation, remember that the left margin
                     plus the indentation  must  be  a  positive  number
                     (i.e.  equal  to  or  greater than one).  Paragraph
                     Indent is used mainly when formatting a paragraph (
                     <Ctrl P> ).  Remember, when using Paragraph Format,
                     paragraphs must  be  separated  by  a  blank  line,
                     unless  you  are  formatting within Select or Block
                     Modes ( <Ctrl S> or <Ctrl B> ). 

        Paragraph  - Paragraph Left Margin is the column number in which
        Left         you wish to align the left side of  your paragraph.
        Margin       The  left  margin  cannot be greater than the right
                     margin.  In  addition  if  you  are  using negative
                     indentation,  the  indentation  and the left margin
                     must add to a number greater than zero (i.e. one or
                     more). 

        Paragraph  - Paragraph Right Margin is the furthest right column
        Right        in which you wish to have text  in  your paragraph.
        Margin       The  last  column  usually  shown  on the screen is
                     column 80.

        Compare      is set to yes ("Y").  That is, the lines "I  have a
        Mode (Y/N)   large  and lovely yellow pencil box." and "I have a
                     large and lovely yellow pencil box." will match  if
                     the prompt is "Y", but not if it is "N".

        Prompt for - To save or not to save, that is the question.  When
        Save When    making  searches  that  involve  file lists, if you
        Using File   have modified the current file and this flag is set
        Lists (Y/N)  to "Y", then a prompt asking you  if  you  wish  to
                     save the file will appear.  The prompt that appears
                     allows you to save the current file before the next
                     file in the file list is searched.  If this flag is
                     set to "N", the file will automatically be saved. 

        Append     - Most  disk operating systems and many compilers and
        Control Z    editors mark the end of  a  file  with  the  Ctrl-Z
        to End of    character.    To  keep Mr. ED compatible with these
        Files (Y/N)  programs, set this prompt to "Y".    Otherwise, set
                     this prompt to "N".  

        Make Read- - Mr. ED allows you to load and save read-only files.
        Only Files   Sometimes,  however,  this  is  not  desirable (for
        Modifiable   example,  with  version  control  systems).    This
        (Y/N)        option allows you to make any Read-Only file loaded
                     into Mr. ED non-modifiable.  This keeps a file from
                     accidentally  getting changed.  See "Toggle Modify"
                     to switch the "Modifiable" setting for a particular
                     file. 

        Display    - The date and time will be displayed  in  the  lower
        the Time     right  corner  of the screen if you set this prompt
        (Y/N)        to "Y".  If you are perpetually on  New  Year's Day
                     in 1980, then set this prompt to "N".  

        Fast       - For  the  fastest  speed Mr. ED can achieve on your
        Screen       screen, set this prompt to "Y".   However,  on some
        Update       color  monitors  this  fast speed may cause fuzz or
                     snow, if that happens you  may  want  to  set  this
                     prompt to "N".

        Color      - You  can  choose  from one of six color schemes for
        Palette      Mr. ED:  

       1. Default      - Mr. ED determines, to the best of its ability, which
                         of the following palettes to use by asking the bios.

       2. Color        - This palette is the default for EGA or VGA color
                         monitors.

       3. Black & White- A generic boring black and white color palette.  The
                         vanilla ice cream of all the choices.

       4. LCD &        - This palette has been especially created for laptop
          Composite      and portable computers.

       5. Monochrome   - Use this option if you want to take full advantage of
                         a monochrome monitor.

       6. Customized   - This palette is a thank you for registered users.
          Colors         When used with the configuration utility all colors
                         in Mr. ED can be customized to you liking.



        Screen on  - You can make Mr. ED do one of four  things  to  the
        Exit         screen when you leave the program: 

             1. Clear Border - If you have a CGA or VGA monitor, this
                               choice will clear the border on the edge
                               of the screen.  Otherwise, this choice is
                               the same as 3. Do Nothing.

             2. Clear Screen - This choice will return you to your
                               operating system with a blank screen.

             3. Do Nothing   - This choice will leave whatever is currently
                               on the screen and put your operating system
                               prompt on the bottom line.

             4. Restore      - This choice will put whatever you had on the
                Original       screen before you entered Mr. ED back on the
                Screen         screen.


        Use 43/50  - When using a VGA or EGA monitor, you can use Mr. ED
        Line Mode    in a compressed mode, that is a mode with more than
        (Y/N)        25 lines on the screen.    To  use  this compressed
                     mode, change this prompt to "Y".

        Enable     - Pulldown   Menus   are   the   lists   of  commands
        Pulldown     categorized into topics that show up at the top  of
        Menus (Y/N)  the  screen when you press <Esc>.  If a long prompt
                     shows up at the bottom of the screen instead of  at
                     the  top  when you press <Esc>, that is the Command
                     Mode prompt and the Enable  Pulldown  Menus  prompt
                     has been set to "N".  Using the Pulldown Menus is a
                     helpful  way  to  learn  and access all of Mr. ED's
                     features.   To  use  the  Pulldown  Menus,  set the
                     prompt to "Y".  The advantage of using Command Mode
                     over  the  Pulldown  Menus  is  that  Command  Mode
                     requires less keystrokes to execute a command  than
                     the Pulldown Menus. 

        Use        - If  your  keyboard has, and your Bios supports, the
        Enhanced     <F11> and <F12> function keys,  then  you  can  set
        Keyboard     this  prompt  to "Y" so that you can use those keys
        Calls (Y/N)  for Macros.  Keep this prompt set  to  "N"  if your
                     machine (and Bios) is older or if you have an older
                     version of a keyboard enhancer such as SuperKey. 

        Screen     - When  using multiple windows, the screen can be set
        Default      in any of  three  styles:    full  screen, vertical
        (Full/       split,  and  horizontal  split.   Full screen means
         Vert/       each window uses the entire screen; only one window
         Horiz)      is shown on the screen at a time.    Vertical split
                     means  that  the  screen  is split vertically, with
                     Window 1 on the left  and  each  increasing  window
                     number  to the right of it.  Horizontal split means
                     the screen is split horizontally, with Window 1  at
                     the  top  of  the screen, Window 2 below that, etc.
                     Depending on the default setup you want,  set  this
                     prompt  to  "F"  for  full screen, "V" for vertical
                     split, and "H" for horizontal split.  To  change to
                     the   next   window   style  when  in  the  editing
                     environment, press <Ctrl N>.    Press  <Ctrl  Z> to
                     zoom  to full screen style from either of the other
                     styles.  Press <Ctrl Z> again to  return.   When in
                     vertical  or  horizontal styles, press <Ctrl Up> or
                     <Ctrl Dn> to increase or decrease each window size. 

        Auto       - If you want Mr. ED to start with  Auto  Indent  on,
        Indent       then   set   this   prompt  to  "Y".    Auto Indent
        Default      automatically indents a new line the same amount as
        (Y/N)        the previous line.  Once inside Mr. ED  switch Auto
                     Indent on and off by pressing <Ctrl I>.  

        Word Wrap  - If you want Mr. ED to start with Word Wrap on, then
        Default      set  this  prompt  to  "Y".    Word  Wrap  uses the
        (Y/N)        paragraph margin and indentation information at the
                     top of the first Environment page to wrap words  to
                     a  new line as you type.  If you modify a paragraph
                     and you want to format it  again,  press  <Ctrl P>.
                     When  inside  Mr.  ED,  press <Ctrl W> to turn Word
                     Wrap on and off.

        Insert     - If you set this prompt to "Y", then when you  start
        Mode         Mr. ED it will be in Insert Mode.  If you set it to
        Default      "N",  Mr.  ED  will  start  in  Overlay Mode.  When
        (Y/N)        typing in Overlay Mode you type over any characters
                     already at the cursor.  Insert Mode acts  just like
                     it  sounds; any character you type will be inserted
                     at the cursor, while any character already  at  the
                     cursor  will be moved to the right.  You can switch
                     between the modes by pressing <Ins>.  Look  for the
                     "Insert"   or  "Overlay"  in  the  middle  of  each
                     window's Status Line to tell  you  what  mode  that
                     window is in. 

        Search     - When  using  Search  or Search and Replace, you can
        Expression   use Regular Expressions in the Search Patterns.   A
        Default      Regular  Expression is a set of commands similar to
        (Y/N)        the DOS "*" and "?" wild cards that gives you  more
                     versatility  in your Search Patterns.  Setting this
                     prompt to "N" means that as the default the  Search
                     Patterns  are  literal and Regular Expressions will
                     not be used.  You can  easily  change  this  to "Y"
                     when  in  Search  if  you  decide  to  use  Regular
                     Expressions. 

        Search     - When Mr. ED looks  for  a  match  using  Search  or
        Case         Search  and Replace, you can specify whether or not
        Default      to take the upper  or  lower  case  of  the  Search
        (Y/N)        Pattern  into account.  You can change it each time
                     you Search, or, if you usually want case to matter,
                     you can change this default prompt to "Y". 

        Search     - A token simply means that when a Search Pattern  is
        Token        found,   it  cannot  have  any  other  alphanumeric
        Default      characters next to it.  For example, if the "token"
        (Y/N)        field is "Y", then the Search  Pattern  "th"  would
                     match  "th"  but  it would not match "the", "that",
                     "th1", etc. This prompt sets the  default  for  the
                     search token prompt.  Remember, you can change this
                     at  the  Search  prompt each time you use Search if
                     you wish. 

        Split Line - Normally when you are in Overlay mode and you press
        in Overlay   <Enter>, a line will be  added  after  the  current
        Mode (Y/N)   line  or  the  current  line  will  be split at the
                     cursor position.   If  you  wish  to  press <Enter>
                     while  in  Overlay  mode  and not have lines added,
                     then  set  this  prompt  to  "Y".    Switch between
                     Overlay and Insert modes by pressing the <Ins> key. 

        Anchor     - If  you  set this prompt to "Y", then when you move
        Cursor       around using the <F3>,  <F4>,  <PgUp>,  and  <PgDn>
        During       keys, the cursor will stay in the same place on the
        Scroll       screen.    Normally  (i.e.  when  set  to "N"), the
        (Y/N)        cursor moves around the screen  but  stays  on  the
                     same line in the file when using these keys.  


                                    Page 41





        Move to    - When  using <Ctrl Lft> or <Ctrl Rgt> to move to the
        Beginning    previous or next word,  usually  you  move  to  the
        of Words     beginning  of  words with <Ctrl Lft> and to the end
        Only (Y/N)   of each word with <Ctrl Rgt>.  Setting  this prompt
                     to  "Y"  changes <Ctrl Rgt> so that you move to the
                     beginning of each word instead of the  end.   Thus,
                     if  you  set  this  prompt  to "Y", you move to the
                     beginning of words only. 

        Make Home/ - In Mr. ED, the <Home> and <End> keys  are  normally
        End Keys     dynamic, that is, when you press <Home> and you are
        Static       already  in  the Home position (column one) on that
        (Y/N)        line, you will move to the  Home  position  on  the
                     previous line.  Similarly, when you press <End> and
                     you are already at the end of the current line, you
                     will move to the end of the next line.  If you wish
                     to  change  this  so  that  the cursor stays on the
                     current line regardless of how many times you press
                     <Home> or <End> (that is to make them static), then
                     set this prompt to "Y". 

        Convert    - In order to minimize file  size,  Mr.  ED  converts
        Spaces to    multiple  spaces  to  tab  characters  when  saving
        Tabs (Y/N)   files.  This conversion will  have  no  effect upon
                     your  file  when working in Mr. ED; however, it may
                     have an effect if you import the file into  a  word
                     processor  or other program.  Set the prompt to "N"
                     to turn off the conversion. 

        Default    - When you press <Tab>,  the  cursor  will  move  the
        Cursor Tab   number  of  spaces specified at this prompt.  There
        Width        are two things  to  note,  however.    One  is that
        [1..255]     pressing  <Tab>  does  not enter a tab character or
                     that number of spaces into  your  file;  it  merely
                     moves  the cursor.  The other thing to note is that
                     if the current file extension is listed in  any  of
                     the  default  file extension lists, then any Cursor
                     Tab Width specified there will be dominant. 

        Default    - When you press <Ctrl Tab>, a physical  tab  of  the
        Physical     width  specified at this prompt will be inserted at
        Tab Width    the cursor location.  As with the Cursor Tab Width,
        [2,4,8]      if a  Physical  Tab  Width  is  specified  for  the
                     current   file   extension   in  the  default  file
                     extension lists, then that Physical Tab Width  will
                     have  precedence.   The Physical Tab Width can have
                     one of three values:  2, 4, or 8. 










                                    Page 42





        Default    - A  token  in  this  sense  is  a  word  or  set  of
        Token        characters   that  have  another  word  or  set  of
        Match        characters  that  always  correspond  to  it.   The
        Rule         Default Token Match Rule applies to all files whose
                     file  extensions  are  not  listed  in  any  of the
                     Default  File  Extensions.    When  setting  up the
                     Default   Token  Match  Rule,  token  partners  are
                     separated  by  the  "="  character.    Use  the ";"
                     character  to  separate sets of partners from other
                     sets.  If one token can have more than one partner,
                     then those other partners are separated by the  "|"
                     character.  For example, if the token match rule is
                     given  by "(*=*);BEGIN|CASE=END", then the match to
                     (* is *), the match to BEGIN is END, and the  match
                     to  CASE  is  END.    Mr.  ED allows the nesting of
                     tokens so if you are looking for the match  to  the
                     first  parenthesis in an area like "(text one (text
                     two) text three)",  then  Mr.  ED  would  skip  the
                     middle  parentheses  and move to the last one.  You
                     may have up to two "="s in a set.  For  example, if
                     a  Token Match Rule is "IF=ELSE=ENDIF", then Mr. ED
                     will find all of the ELSE's  in  the  IF  statement
                     before it finds the ENDIF.  To use Token Match, set
                     the  cursor on one of the tokens, press <Ctrl T> or
                     select Token Match from the Search  pulldown  menu,
                     and  Mr.  ED  will  find its match.  If there is no
                     rule for the token you are looking for, Mr. ED will
                     find the next occurrence of that word in your file. 

        Default    - By specifying one or more file extensions here, you
        File         can tailor the operation  of  several  commands  to
        Extensions   specific  languages or file types.  You can specify
                     token match rules  (explained  below),  cursor  and
                     physical  tab  widths,  and to allow the ability to
                     nest token comments.  Whenever Mr. ED loads  a file
                     whose   extension  is  listed  here,  Mr.  ED  will
                     automatically modify any  commands  specified here.
                     In  addition,  when  loading  files  from  the Load
                     command  or  when  specifying  file  names  on  the
                     command  line, you can leave off the file extension
                     and Mr. ED will automatically  find  and  load  the
                     file  using the default file extensions given here.
                     Mr. ED will look at  all  the  file  extensions  in
                     Default  File  Extension(s) 1, then 2, then 3, then
                     4, but first it will look to see  if  a  file  with
                     that  name  exists  with  no extension.  To specify
                     more than one file extension,  separate  them  with
                     the "|" character.

        Token      - A  token  in  this  sense  is  a  word  or  set  of
        Match        characters  that  have  another  word  or  set   of
        Rule         characters  that  always  correspond  to  it.   For
                     example, if you begin a  comment  with  "(*",  then
                     someplace  farther in the file must be the close of
                     that comment, "*)".    When  setting  up  the Token
                     Match  Rule,  the partner of the start of a comment
                     is separated from it by a "-" character.  All other
                     token partners are separated by the  "=" character.
                     Use  the ";" character to separate sets of partners
                     from other sets.  If one token can  have  more than
                     one   partner,   then   those  other  partners  are
                     separated by the "|" character.    For  example, if
                     the     token    match    rule    is    given    by
                     "(*-*);BEGIN|CASE|RECORD=END", then the match to (*
                     is *), the match to BEGIN is END, the match to CASE
                     is END, and the match to RECORD  is  END.    Mr. ED
                     uses the "-" character to tell what are comments so
                     that  you  can turn the nesting of comments off and
                     on.  In addition,  if  other  tokens  are  within a
                     commented  section, Mr. ED will skip them entirely.
                     Mr. ED always allows the nesting of tokens  if  you
                     have  separated  the  parts with the "=" character.
                     You may have up to two "="s in a set.  For example,
                     if a Token Match Rule is "IF=ELSE=ENDIF", then  Mr.
                     ED  will find all of the ELSE's in the IF statement
                     before it finds the ENDIF.  To use Token Match, set
                     the cursor on one of the tokens,  press  <Ctrl  T>,
                     and Mr. ED will find its match. 

        Cursor Tab - If  the  current  file  extension  is listed in the
        Width        Default  File  Extensions  associated   with   this
                     prompt,  then when you press <Tab>, the cursor will
                     move the number of spaces specified at this prompt.
                     Note, however, that pressing <Tab> does not  put  a
                     tab  character  or  the  number of spaces specified
                     into your file; it merely moves the cursor. 

        Physical   - If the current file  extension  is  listed  in  the
        Tab Width    Default   File   Extensions  associated  with  this
                     prompt, then when you press <Ctrl Tab>, a  physical
                     tab  of  the width specified at this prompt will be
                     inserted at the cursor location.  The  Physical Tab
                     Width can have one of three values:  2, 4, or 8. 

        Nest Token - If  your compiler allows same symbol comments to be
        Comments     nested, then set this prompt to "Y".   Mr.  ED will
        (Y/N)        then  determine  which  are  the matching pairs and
                     move to the appropriate one.   For  example,  if /*
                     and  */  are  the  open and close of comments and a
                     portion of your file looks like this:  "/*  /* (any
                     amount  of  text  over any number of lines) */ text
                     */", then if you put the cursor on the  first  open
                     comment  (/*)  and  pressed  <Ctrl T>, Mr. ED would
                     move directly to the second close  comment  symbol,

                     skipping the complete set of open and close comment
                     symbols between them. 

        Default    - Enter  the  location  of your usual printer at this
        Printer      prompt.  Valid locations include  PRN,  LPT1, LPT2,
        Port         COM1, COM2, COM3, and COM4.  At each print you have
                     the  option  to  change  the  printer port for that
                     particular print job. 

        Default    - Set this prompt to the left margin you  prefer  for
        Printer      your  printer.    The  left margin must be a number
        Left Margin  between and including 1 and 255.  Like  the printer
        [1..255]     port,  you  can change it for each print job if you
                     desire. 

        Default    - Printer page size is the number of lines  you  wish
        Printer      to print on a page before a page break.  Any number
        Page Size    between  and  including 0 and 400 is valid.  A page
        [0..400]     size of 0 means that no page breaks  will  be made.
                     Like  the  printer  port  and  left margin, you can
                     change this  number  for  each  print  job  if  you
                     desire. 

        Beep       - Whenever  an  invalid  key  is pressed, Mr. ED will
        Duration     warn you with a  beep.    This  is  your  chance to
        [1..65535]   decide  how  long  that  beep will last.  Different
                     computers  have  different  internal  speeds  so  a
                     little  experimentation  may  be needed to find the
                     ideal beep duration.  When you move off this prompt
                     after you have changed the beep  duration,  Mr.  ED
                     will beep at you so you will know what the new beep
                     duration sounds like. 

        Message    - Whenever  Mr.  ED  runs into some kind of error, it
        Display      will display a message on the bottom  line  of  the
        Duration     screen.    By  entering a number between 1 and 100,
        [1..100]     inclusive, you can determine the length of time the
                     message will be displayed.    Multiples  of  18 are
                     seconds.    For  example,  a  value of 36 means the
                     message will be displayed for 2 seconds.   When you
                     move  off  this  prompt  after you have changed the
                     display duration, Mr. ED will show  you  a  message
                     using  the  new  display  time so you will know how
                     long messages will now be displayed. 

        Number of  - The number of K for file  list  is  the  number  of
        K for File   kilobytes  of memory you wish Mr. ED to reserve for
        List         the file list.  Only  if  you  use  amazingly large
        [1..64]      file  lists will you need more than 12K.  If you do
                     not use file lists, you can set this prompt to 1. 







                                    Page 45





        Number of  - The number of K  for  compiler  is  the  number  of
        K for        kilobytes  of memory you wish Mr. ED to reserve for
        Compiler     your  compiler.    Mr.  ED  will  leave   that many
        [0..640]     kilobytes  of  memory  open so when you invoke your
                     compiler or other program  using  (OS)  Command  it
                     will have enough memory to operate. 

        Source     - Source  File  Path is the path along which you wish
        File Path    Mr. ED to look for files during  loading.    If the
                     file  you  wish  to  load  is located in one of the
                     directories listed in the path, then  you  can  use
                     Mr.  ED in any directory and load that file without
                     specifying a  path.    This  feature  is especially
                     useful  when  working  on  a  project  contained in
                     multiple directories. 

        Create a   - If you wish Mr. ED to save your original file as  a
        Backup       backup file with the same filename, but with a .BAK
        File (Y/N)   extension,  every time you save your file, then set
                     this prompt to "Y".  No backup will be  made  if it
                     is set to "N". 

        Backup     - To   save   your   backup  files  to  a  particular
        Directory    directory, enter that directory here.    If  you do
                     not  specify  a  directory,  Mr.  ED  will save the
                     backup files in the current directory. 

        Auto-Load/ - If you set this prompt to "Y", then every time  you
        Save Macro   load  Mr.  ED a macro file will also be loaded, and
        File (Y/N)   every time you leave Mr. ED your macro file will be
                     saved.  A  Mr.  ED  macro  file  must  have  a .MAC
                     extension.  If you have a support path, Mr. ED will
                     look  through  directories  for a macro file in the
                     following   order:        current    directory, all
                     directories  listed  in the Path for Support Files,
                     directory containing ED.EXE, and then the operating
                     system path.  Just to confuse you,  if  you  do not
                     specify  a  support path (you leave it blank), then
                     Mr. ED looks through the directories in a different
                     order:     directory   containing   ED.EXE, current
                     directory, and then the operating system path. 

        Path for   - Path  for  Support Files is the list of directories
        Support      in which you wish Mr. ED to look for support files.
        Files        Support files include the help file (MR_ED.HLP) and
                     macro files (e.g. MR_ED.MAC). 

        Scratch    - Since Mr. ED is disk based it  sometimes  needs  to
        File         dump   excess  data  out  to  disk.    This  is the
        Directory    directory in which you wish Mr. ED to  place  these
                     special  scratch  files.   If you leave this prompt
                     blank, Mr. ED will use the current  directory.   If
                     you  wish to take advantage of your ram disk simply
                     enter the appropriate path name.

                                Escape Sequences

             In addition to regular expressions, Search and  Search  and
        Replace  also  accept escape sequences similar to the C language
        for both Search and  Replace  Patterns.    Escape  sequences are
        separate  from regular expressions so you do not need to turn on
        regular expressions to use escape sequences.    They  are called
        escape  sequences  because the "\" character is sometimes called
        the escape character.

                               File List Commands



        C - Copy to Select is used to copy the file list to the  "select
            buffer".    This is useful for constructing batch files that
            manipulate the files selected. 

        D - Delete Untagged removes all of the untagged file names  from
            the file list.  Use this command to tailor the file list. 

        P - Print  sends  the  list  of  file  names to the printer that
            corresponds  to  the  printer  location  specified  in   the
            Environment Menu. 

        R - Remove  List  is  used  to  delete the entire file list from
            memory. 

        S - Save is used to save the list of  tagged  file  names  to  a
            file.   This is a very convenient way of working with select
            groups of files. 


        Note: These commands can be invoked  when  you  are  moving  the
              cursor  around in the file list -- you do not need to take
              the extra step of pressing the <Tab> key to bring  up  the
              command prompt.

                                   File Lists





             A  file  list  is  a file which contains the names of other
        files.  A file list allows you to work with the files for a full
        project or with a particular characteristic, like all containing
        the same search pattern.  It makes no difference if  these files
        are  in  different directories or even on different drives.  The
        file list keeps track of each file's  location.    For instance,
        say  you  wish  to  search  for "dumb_variable" in certain files
        contained in the C:\PAS and C:\PROJ directories and they are  in
        a  file  list  called MYFILE.LST.  All you need to do is to load
        the file list and perform a Forward Search  for "dumb_variable".
        Mr.  ED will automatically load and search each file in the file
        list until "dumb_variable" is found.

                  Conventions to Use When Creating File Lists


       Convention           Use
       Path                 If no path or drive for a file is given, the
                            current directory or drive is assumed.
       |                    The remainder of the line is a comment.
       *,?                  Wild cards can be used for specifying groups
                            of files.
       !                    The "!" character can be used to exclude
                            specific files that would have been included
                            because of wildcards.  For example, !FILL.PAS
                            would exclude FILL.PAS from the file list if
                            it would have been included due to a *.PAS,
                            FILL.*, or a similar file mask.

                                   File Menu



        Append     - Append is used to append a file after any  line  in
                     the  current  window.  You specify the file and the
                     line number. 

        Command    - Command, also called  OS  Command,  allows  you  to
                     execute an operating system command from within Mr.
                     ED.    You  can  direct  the  output to the current
                     window  or  the  operating  system  screen.    This
                     command is ideal for compiling. 

        Load       - Load  is  used  to  load  a  file  into the current
                     window.  The maximum size of  a  file  that  can be
                     loaded is 64,000 lines. 

        Multi View - Multi  View  allows  you to look at, and work with,
                     the same file from two  or  more  windows.   Making
                     changes  in  one window will change the file in all
                     other Multi Viewed windows.  To use Multi  View you
                     must  have  at least two windows open.  You will be
                     prompted for the window number  you  wish  to  view
                     from  an  additional  window.  If there is only one
                     other window open, the assumption is made you  wish
                     a second view of that other window. 

        New        - New  clears  the  file from the current window.  If
                     the file has been modified since it was last saved,
                     you are asked if you really wish to do this. 

        OS Shell   - OS Shell allows you to invoke an occurrence of  the
                     operating  system.   This allows you to perform all
                     of the DOS commands (copy files, play games,  etc.)
                     and  still  remain  in  Mr.  ED.   When you wish to
                     return to Mr. ED simply enter the EXIT  command  in
                     response to the DOS prompt. 

        Print      - Print  is  used  when  you wish to print the entire
                     file.  You can print portions  of  your  file using
                     Select ( <Ctrl S> ) or Block ( <Ctrl B> ) modes. 

        Quit       - Quit  exits Mr. ED.  If you have modified a file in
                     one of  the  windows,  you  are  shown  a  list  of
                     modified  files  and  prompted to see if you really
                     wish to exit. 

        Rename     - Rename is used to  change  the  default  file name.
                     The default file name is the file name displayed in
                     the  right  hand  portion of the status line and is
                     used as the default when saving the file.  Only the
                     file name in Mr. ED is changed; the  file  on  disk
                     still has the original name. 

        Save       - Save  is  used  to  save  the  file  on disk.  This


                                    Page 52





                     command will ask you for the name of  the  file  to
                     save.   If you wish to save the file to the default
                     file name  then  simply  press  <Enter>,  otherwise
                     enter a new file name. 

        Toggle     - Toggle  Modify  allows  you to make a file that was
        Modify       "Modifiable", unmodifiable and vice versa.   If you
                     make  a  file  unmodifiable,  the  file  can not be
                     altered in any way.    This  is  great  for version
                     control  systems,  and other times when you want to
                     keep a file from accidentally getting changed. 

        Update     - Update is similar to the Save command  except  that
                     it  exits  the current window in addition to saving
                     the file.  If there is only one window in use, then
                     after the file is saved you  will  be  returned  to
                     DOS.  Otherwise, the current window will be dropped
                     and  the  you  will  be  positioned  in an adjacent
                     window. 

        Version    - Version displays the current version of Mr.  ED  in
                     which you are working. 

        + Next     - Next File loads the next file in the file list into
        File         the  current  window.    It  only  works if you are
                     working with file lists.  You can press <Ctrl +> to
                     implement this command while in screen mode (normal
                     file editing mode). 

        - Prev     - Similar to  Next  File,  Previous  File  loads  the
        File         previous  file  in  the  file list into the current
                     window.  Again, this command only works if  you are
                     using  file  lists.    You  can  press  <Ctrl -> to
                     implement this command while in screen mode.

                                File Select Mode


             File Select Mode ( <Shift F2> )  is  a  special  mode  that
        allows  you  to  select a file to load from your file list.  You
        can select a file by using the arrow keys and most of the  other
        keypad  keys.  Once you move the cursor to the desired file name
        you can load the file by pressing <Enter>, or <Esc> and  <Enter>
        if  you  no  longer wish to use the file list.  A summary of the
        various commands valid in File Select Mode follows. 




        Lft,Rgt,Up,Dn    Move cursor along row or column -- wrap at boundary.
        +,-              Move sequentially to next or previous file -- no wrap.
        PgDn,PgUp        Next or previous page of file names (if one exists).
        Home,End         Move to beginning or end of row.
        Ctrl Home/End    Move to beginning or end of file list.
        F8               Physically remove file from list.
        F1               Undo last file physically removed.
        T,U              Tag or untag the current file.
        Ctrl T/U         Tag or untag all files.
        Tab              View File List commands.
        C,D,P,R,S        Execute specific File List command.




             Untagged files are skipped in Searches and when loading the
        next and previous files in the file list  (<Ctrl  +>  and  <Ctrl
        ->).

                              Goto Line or Marker


             At  the  Line Number prompt in Goto Line or Marker, you can
        enter a line number or a marker.  A marker  is  just  a specific
        line  and  column  that  you have chosen or "marked".  To goto a
        marker, press the letter, A, B, C, or D,  corresponding  to  the
        location in the file you wish to move to.  If you are using file
        list you can use markers to goto any location in any file in the
        list. 

             If  you  hit  <Enter>  without  entering  a  line number or
        marker, you will be moved to the last marker you  used,  and  if
        you  are  currently  at  a marker, you will be moved to the last
        marker you used before that.  An additional marker you  can move
        to  is the Automatic Marker.  The Automatic Marker is set, well,
        automatically at the last location  you  made  changes  in  your
        file.  Select Marker E to move to the Automatic Marker. 

             To  set  a marker, press <Shift F8> or select Set Marker on
        the Goto pulldown menu and press a letter to set the marker. 

             You can use Goto Line or Marker by pressing <Shift  F7>  or
        by selecting Goto Line/Marker on the Goto pulldown menu.

                                   Goto Menu


        Set Marker - Markers  are  used  to  mark a specific location in
                     your file.  Each  window  has  a  different  set of

                     using file list you can use  markers  to  goto  any
                     location in any file in the list.  If you hit Enter
                     without  entering a line number or marker, you will
                     be moved to the last marker you used,  and  if  you
                     are currently at a marker, you will be moved to the
                     last  marker  you  used before that.  An additional
                     marker you can move  to  is  the  Automatic Marker.
                     The Automatic Marker is set, well, automatically at
                     the  last  location  you made changes in your file.

        loaded is 64,000  lines.    Answering  "N"  to  the "Modifiable"
        prompt tells Mr. ED that the file can not be altered in any way. 

             If  you  are  not sure of the file name or you wish to work
        with a File List then you can enter a file mask (e.g. *.PAS)  or
        press <Enter> for everything.  When you enter a mask, all of the
        files  that  match  the  mask  will be sorted alphabetically and
        displayed on the screen.    The  first  name  displayed  will be
        highlighted.    From  this  point  you can use the arrow keys to
        select the file you wish to load.  If you wish to  enter another
        file name or file mask, or do not wish to load the list of files
        with your file, then press <Esc> and you will be returned to the
        file name prompt. 

             When  you load a file name via a file mask you are actually
        working with a list of  files.    That  is,  you  will  have the
        ability  to  edit  and  access any file in the "file list".  You
        will also be able to search (and replace)  one  or  more  search
        patterns  in  all  of the files in the list.  Besides entering a
        file mask you can also specify a File List by reading a list  of
        file  names  from a file.  This is accomplished by preceding the
        file of file names with the "@" character (e.g. @JON.LST).   The
        names  in the file can be standard DOS file names or they can in
        turn be file masks (e.g. *.INT).

                                     Macros



             Macros are a series of keystrokes or commands that you  can
        play  back  by  pressing  one  key.  For example, you may have a
        simple macro defined as <Alt S> that will save the current file.
        If you use Pulldown Menus, this simple macro will  save  you  at
        least three keystrokes each time you use it. 

             To record a macro, press <Alt => and select Record a Macro.
        Choose  the  key to which you wish to assign the macro, that is,
        the key or key combination you  wish  to  press  to  start  your
        macro,  and  then  start entering the keys and commands you wish
        your macro to remember.   Choose  your  key  or  key combination
        wisely;  if,  in  the  example above, <S> had been chosen as the
        macro key, then whenever an S was typed during normal use of Mr.
        ED  the  macro  would  have  been  initiated.     The   best key
        combinations  to  use  are  <Alt  letter>  combinations.  During
        recording of a macro the word "Recording" will be  displayed  at
        the  bottom of the screen.  When you wish to stop recording your
        macro,  press  <Alt  =>  and  select  "End  and  Save   Recorded
        Keystrokes".   If it didn't turn out the way you want it, select
        "Quit and Erase Recorded Keystrokes"  and  your  macro  will  no
        longer  exist.  You may wish to go through all of the keystrokes
        of a macro before recording recording it since the only  way  to
        edit a macro is to re-record it. 

             There are two commands that are of special use when you are
        recording  a  macro.    They  are  "Overlay Character" and "Exit
        Screen Mode".  Characters may be  entered  in  one  of  two data
        modes,  Insert  or  Overlay.    "Overlay  Characters" (<Ctrl O>)
        forces the data mode to be Overlay.  The data mode  may  then be
        toggled  between  Insert  and  Overlay  by  using  the  INS key.
        Normally to access Command Mode, you press the <Esc>  key.   The
        problem  is  that  the <Esc> key also toggles you back to Screen
        Mode.  To remedy this problem, "Exit Screen Mode" (<Ctrl X>) was
        introduced.  This command will toggle you into  Command  Mode or
        just  keep  you  in  Command  mode.  Therefore when you use this
        command, you always know which mode you are starting  the  macro
        in. 

             To  pause a macro during recording and playback, press <Alt
        => and choose "Pause the  Macro  for  Your  Input".    To resume
        recording  of your macro, press <Alt ->.  Your macro, when it is
        played back, will pause at this same place.  To  resume playback
        of  your  macro,  press  <Alt  ->.   When a macro is paused, the
        message "Alt- Resume" will be displayed at  the  bottom  of  the
        screen.    If you press <Alt => when a macro is paused, playback
        of the remainder of the macro will be canceled.

             To play a macro, press  the  key  or  key  combination  you
        assigned  your  macro  to,  or  press <Alt => and select "Play a
        Macro".  You will be shown a list of all of the currently loaded
        macros to choose from.  When a  macro  is  playing,  the message
        "Playing" will be displayed at the bottom of the screen.  If Mr.
        ED  tells  you that no macros are defined but you know they have
        been, then you need to load a macro file.  See "To load  a macro
        file" below. 

             To  erase a macro that doesn't do what it is supposed to or
        one you no longer need, select Erase a Macro.  Once erased, that
        macro is gone, never to be heard from again.   Unless  of course
        you  saved  it  in  a  macro file and you reload that macro file
        before you save the current macro file  without  the  macro  you
        just erased.  Say that ten times fast without taking a breath. 

             To  load  a macro file, one that already contains macros in
        Mr. ED format, select Load Macro File.  If  you  have previously
        loaded  a macro file or have recorded new ones, the newly loaded
        macro file will replace all,  until  now,  current  macros.   By
        setting the Auto-Load/Save Macro prompt on the third page of the
        Environment  Menu to Yes, you can request Mr. ED to load a macro
        file each time you enter Mr. ED. 

             To save macros, ones that you wish to use again in Mr.  ED,
        select Save Macro File.  All of the current macros will be saved
        to  the file with the name you specify.  You can keep macros for
        differing  purposes  in  different   files   or   in   different
        directories,  but  each time you save, all of the current macros
        will be saved to the same file.  When you wish to perform a task
        for which you have a macro, just load the proper macro file.  By
        setting the Auto-Load/Save Macro prompt on the third page of the
        Environment Menu to Yes, you can request  Mr.  ED  to  save  the
        current macro file each time you leave Mr. ED.

                                   Modes Menu


        Adjust     - Use  Adjust  Mode to modify the indentation of your
                     text.  Adjust the indentation by using the left and
                     right arrow keys, or by pressing <L>, <C>,  or  <R>
                     to left, center, or right justify the current line.
                     Using  the  up  and  down  arrow  keys  adjusts the
                     previous and next line the same amount as you  just
                     adjusted  the  current line.  You can select Adjust
                     or press <Ctrl A> to enter Adjust Mode. 

        Block      - Block Mode allows you to select  and  work  with  a
                     rectangular  block  of text.  You can copy, delete,
                     save, print, or move your block  by  deleting  then
                     pasting  it,  in  addition to other options.  Enter
                     Block Mode by selecting Block or by pressing  <Ctrl
                     B>. 

        Condensed  - Condensed Mode creates a window which only contains
                     lines  from  the  current  window that start with a
                     letter (no  leading  spaces).    You  can  move the
                     highlight  bar up and down to different lines using
                     cursor movement keys.  By pressing <Enter> you will
                     move the cursor to that new line.    Condensed Mode
                     works  well  for  moving  among  procedures and for
                     recalling procedure names and  required parameters.
                     You can select Condensed or press <Ctrl C> to enter
                     Condensed Mode. 

        Drawing    - Line  Drawing Mode allows you, amazingly enough, to
                     draw lines on the screen!  You  can  use predefined
                     line  styles  or choose your own characters.  Enter
                     Line  Drawing  Mode  by  selecting  Drawing  or  by
                     pressing <Ctrl D>. 

        Extended   - You  can  enter  any  character  in the extended or
        Char         control character sets  within  Extended  Character
                     Mode.    To  enter  control  characters once in the
                     Extended Character Mode, press the  <Ctrl>  key  in
                     combination  with the desired character, or if only
                     entering one control character,  simply  press  the
                     corresponding  alphabetic  key  (e.g. press "a" for
                     <Ctrl A>).   To  enter  the  decimal  number  of an
                     extended character use the <Alt> key in conjunction
                     with  the  keypad.  To exit Extended Character Mode
                     press  <Ctrl  Break>.    To  enter  more   than one
                     character,  set  the  Repeat Factor before entering
                     Extended  Character  Mode.      To   enter Extended
                     Character  Mode select Extended Char or press <Ctrl
                     E>. 

        File       - File Select Mode allows you to  select  a  file  to
        Select       load  from your file list.  You can't use this mode
                     without a file list.  In addition to selecting File
                     Select,  File  Select  Mode  can  be  accessed   by


                                    Page 61





                     pressing <Shift F2>. 

        Kompare    - Compare  Mode performs a comparison of the files in
                     all of the open windows.  Place the  cursor  on the
                     line  in  each  file  where  you  wish to begin the
                     comparison, press <Ctrl K> or select  Kompare,  and
                     Mr.  ED  will  highlight  the  current line in each
                     window as it performs the comparison.  Mr.  ED will
                     stop  at the first set of lines that do not compare
                     exactly.  If you only have one window open,  Mr. ED
                     will  give  you  the  highlight bar to use, but you
                     can't do no comparing 'cause you ain't got  nothin'
                     to compare. 

        Link       - Link  Mode  links all of the open windows together.
                     When linked, windows will move simultaneously  when
                     you  use  cursor  movement  keys.   That is, if you
                     press <PgUp> then all of the windows will move  you
                     one  page  up, likewise with other cursor commands.
                     Enter Link mode by selecting Link  or  by  pressing
                     <Ctrl L>. 

        Select     - Select  Mode  allows  you to select and work with a
                     stream of text.  You can copy, delete, save, print,
                     or move your selected text by deleting then pasting
                     it, in addition to  other  options.    Enter Select
                     Mode by selecting Select or by pressing <Ctrl S>. 

        Paste      - Paste  Block/Select  pastes the current contents of
        Block/       the select buffer at the cursor location.  If, when
        Select       using Select or Block Modes,  you  copied  text  to
                     memory using Copy, Delete, or Append to Buffer, you
                     can  use  this  command  to  paste  the text at the
                     cursor.   Only  the  last  Copy  or  Delete  can be
                     pasted;  all  others  are  lost from the computer's
                     memory.  Select Paste Block/Select or press <F2> to
                     paste at the cursor.   Be  careful  if  you  are in
                     Overlay  Mode  when pasting; you will overwrite any
                     text currently at the cursor location.

                                   OS Command


             OS Command allows you to perform operating system  commands
        from  within Mr. ED, and allows you to direct the output of that
        command to the current window.  You may use this  command  to do
        something as simple as copying a file to another directory or as
        complex  as  compiling a program.  Usually you will wish to open
        an additional window for the output of this command so that  you
        can  manipulate  or  peruse  the  data  at your leisure.  If you
        choose not to direct the output to the current window, you  will
        be  placed  in  a  temporary window.  You can look but not touch
        when in the temporary window.  If something  is  already  in the
        current  window  and  you direct the output of this command into
        it, the output will be placed at  the  current  cursor position.
        OS  Command  is  accessed  from  Command  Mode  or from the File
        pulldown menu.  It is called Command on the File pulldown menu. 

             A  helpful  use  for  this  command  is  sorting   a   file
        alphabetically  by line.  Sorting is accomplished by issuing the
        following command at the prompt: 


                                 SORT <filename



             You will probably wish to open  an  additional  window  for
        this sorted file.

        Mark Block - To  rehighlight  the  text  of  your last Select or
        Again        Block Mode, select Mark Block Again or press  <Ctrl
                     M>.  

        Set Repeat - Most  commands in Mr. ED can be executed a multiple
        Factor       number of times, including searches, movement keys,
                     and typing of characters.    To  execute  a command
                     more  than once, set the repeat factor by selecting
                     Set Repeat Factor or by pressing <Ctrl R>.   At the
                     prompt  enter  the  number  of  times  you  wish to
                     execute the  command.    After  setting  the repeat
                     factor, the next command you enter will be executed
                     that  number  times.    For example, a quick way to
                     enter 50 asterisks would  be  to  press  <Ctrl  R>,
                     enter  the  number  "50",  press  <Enter>, and then
                     enter the "*" character. 

        Backward   - Selecting Backward Toggle Case or  pressing  <Shift
        Toggle       F5>  will  switch  the  case  of  the letter at the
        Case         cursor.  In  addition,  the  cursor  will  move one
                     letter to the left.  Upper-case letters will become
                     lower-case  letters  and  vice  versa, but no other
                     characters will be effected. 

        Forward    - Selecting Forward Toggle Case  or  pressing  <Shift
        Toggle       F6>  will  switch  the  case  of  the letter at the
        Case         cursor.  In  addition,  the  cursor  will  move one
                     letter  to  the  right.    Upper-case  letters will
                     become lower-case letters and vice  versa,  but  no
                     other characters will be effected. 

        Macros     - Macros  are a series of keystrokes or commands that
                     you  can  play  back  by  pressing  one  key.   For
                     example,  you  may  have  a simple macro defined as
                     <Alt S> that will save the current file.    All you
                     need  to  do  is press <Alt S> and the current file
                     will be saved.  Select Macros or press  <Alt  => to
                     access   recording,   playing,   and   other  macro
                     commands.  To view Help  on  macros,  select Macros
                     from  the  Help  Index.  Select Help Index or press
                     <Shift F1> from within  Help  to  obtain  the  Help
                     Index. 

        Help Index - The  Help  Index  lists all of the topics for which
                     Help is available.  To view the Help on any  of the
                     topics  listed,  move  the  highlight  bar  to  the
                     desired topic and press <Enter>.    The  Help Index
                     can  be obtained by pressing <Shift F1> from within
                     any Help screen or by  selecting  Help  Index  from
                     this menu.

                              Regular Expressions


             Regular  expressions  are  a  set of commands that give you
        more versatility in your Search Patterns.  For  example,  if you
        wish   to  search  for  several  different  words  contained  in
        different sets of brackets, you could use "{*}"  as  the  Search
        Pattern  and  Mr.  ED  would  find  all  the  sets  of  brackets
        regardless of how many characters or words were inside them  (as
        long  as  the brackets were on the same line).  You can continue
        to use words and characters in the Search Patterns  in  addition
        to the regular expression commands. 

             In  addition  to  regular  expressions, Search also accepts
        characters  called  escape  sequences  as  part  of  the  Search
        Pattern.    Escape sequences allow you to search for things like
        tab characters and carriage returns.  A list of escape sequences
        is located after the regular expression commands below. 

             Below is a list of all  of  the  valid  regular  expression
        commands and an explanation for their use. 






   Command                        Description
      *     A "*" will match any number of characters till the end of the line.
      ?     A "?" will match any single non-white space character.  (White
            space characters are space, tab, line feed, and carriage return.)
      %     A "%" at the start of a pattern will force the pattern to be at
            the start of a line.  Any place else it is a normal character.
      $     A "$" at the end of a pattern will force the pattern to be at
            the end of the line.  Any place else it is a normal character.
      @     An "@" will match zero or more occurrences of the expression
            to its left.
      +     A "+" will match one or more occurrences of the expression
            to its left.
      |     A "|" denotes "or".  Use it between patterns or within a
            subexpression.
      \     A "\" located before any regular expression command character
            forces Mr. ED to make a literal search for that character.
      ()    A set of "()" create a subexpression, e.g. "command (line|mode)".
      []    A set of "[]" create a character class or set.  All other
            commands lose their meaning within the []'s.
      ~     A "~" used as the first character within a set causes that set
            to be inverted, e.g. "[~0-9]" means all non-numeric characters.
      -     A "-" used within a set specifies a range of characters, e.g. [a-z].

                                Replace Options


        Replace    - If  you  wish  to replace the highlighted text with
                     the Replace Pattern, just press the <R>  key.   Mr.
                     ED  will  then  replace  the  highlighted  text and
                     resume searching for your Search Pattern. 

        No Replace - If  you  do  not  want  Mr.  ED  to   replace   the
                     highlighted  text  with  the Replace Pattern, press
                     the <N> key and Mr. ED  will  skip  this  text  and
                     resume searching for your Search Pattern. 

        Verify Off - If you are tired of the Replace prompt and you wish
                     to  replace all of the Search Patterns remaining in
                     your file with the Replace Pattern(s),  then  press
                     the <O> key. 

        Enter      - If,  for  this one replace, you wish to replace the
        Pattern      highlighted text with  a  pattern  other  than  the
                     Replace  Pattern, press the <P> key and you will be
                     given the opportunity. 

        Last       - If you wish to replace the highlighted text but  no
        Replace      more after this, press the <L> key. 

        Quit       - If  you  no longer wish to be in Search and Replace
                     and  do  not  wish   to   replace   the   currently
                     highlighted text, press the <Q> key.

                                  Save Command


             Save  is  used  to  save  the file in the current window to
        disk.  Mr. ED will default to  the  current  name,  but  you can
        easily  change it to a different name at the "File Name to Save"
        prompt.  You can choose to save the file  to  the  current name,
        type  in  a  different name, or select a different name to save.
        To save the file to the current name, simply  press  <Enter>  at
        the save prompt. 

             Pressing <Enter> at a blank file name prompt will cause Mr.
        ED  to show you a list of the files in the current directory, or
        in a specific directory if you specified a path at  the  "blank"
        file  name  prompt.  If you are using a file list, you can press
        <Shift F2> to select a file to save to from the file list.

                                 Search Command

        Exp        - To use regular expressions in the  Search  Pattern,
                     set  this prompt to "Y".  Regular expressions are a
                     set of commands that give you more  versatility  in
                     your  Search Patterns.  For example, if you wish to
                     search for several  different  words  contained  in
                     different  sets of brackets, you could use "{*}" as
                     the  Search  Pattern.      Refer   to   the regular
                     expressions help for complete rules. 

        Case       - The Case flag specifies whether or not to perform a
                     case  sensitive  search.  Set this prompt to "N" to
                     perform a case insensitive search.    That  is, the
                     alphabetic  characters  in  the search pattern will
                     match both their upper and lower  case equivalents.
                     For  example,  the  search pattern "the" will match
                     "the", "The", "THE", etc., when the Case prompt  is
                     set to "N". 

        Token      - The  token flag indicates whether or not the search
                     pattern must be a token.  A token simply means that
                     when the pattern is found, it cannot have any other
                     alphanumeric characters next to it.    For example,
                     if  the  "token"  field  is  "Y",  then  the search
                     pattern "th" would match  "th"  but  it  would  not
                     match  "the", "that", "th1", etc. This flag is very
                     useful  when  searching  for  variables  in  source
                     files. 

        Pattern(s) - The pattern is simply what you are looking for.  To
                     search  for  more  than one pattern simply separate
                     each pattern with the "|" character.   For example,
                     to  search for the words "procedure" and "function"
                     simply enter "procedure|function".  You  can search
                     for  a  maximum of 10 different patterns.  Remember
                     the case and token flags apply to all of the search
                     patterns. 

        Note:        If you are working with a "list of files"  and  the
                     search  pattern  is  not  contained  in the current
                     file, then any active files that follow the current
                     file in the file list (for a forward  search)  will
                     also  be  searched.    If  you  wish to confine the
                     search to the current file, then invoke File Select
                     Mode ( <Shift F2> ) and press <Ctrl  U>  so  as  to
                     "untag"  the  other  files in the list.  Then press
                     <Esc> to exit from File Select Mode.  Refer  to the
                     instructions  and  help  in  File  Select  Mode for
                     additional guidance. 

                     If your search brings you to the end  of  the  file
                     list  and  no  more search patterns are found, then
                     you will be put into  the  last  file  in  which  a
                     pattern had been found.

                           Search and Replace Command

        Expression - To  use  regular expressions in the Search Pattern,
                     set this prompt to "Y".  Regular expressions  are a
                     set  of  commands that give you more versatility in
                     your Search Patterns.  For example, if you  wish to
                     search  for  several  different  words contained in
                     different sets of brackets, you could use "{*}"  as
                     the   Search   Pattern.      Refer  to  the regular
                     expressions help for complete rules. 

        Case       - The Case flag specifies whether or not to perform a
                     case sensitive search.  Set this prompt  to  "N" to
                     perform  a  case  insensitive search.  That is, the
                     alphabetic characters in the  search  pattern  will
                     match  both their upper and lower case equivalents.
                     For example, the search pattern  "the"  will  match
                     "the",  "The", "THE", etc., when the Case prompt is
                     set to "N". 

        Token      - The token flag indicates whether or not the  search
                     pattern must be a token.  A token simply means that
                     when the pattern is found, it cannot have any other
                     alphanumeric  characters  next to it.  For example,
                     if the  "token"  field  is  "Y",  then  the  search
                     pattern  "th"  would  match  "th"  but it would not
                     match "the", "that", "th1", etc. This flag is  very
                     useful  when  searching  for  variables  in  source
                     files. 

        Search     - The Search Pattern is simply what you  are  looking
        Pattern(s)   for.    To  search for more than one pattern simply
                     separate each pattern with the "|" character.   For
                     example,  to  search  for the words "procedure" and
                     "function" simply enter "procedure|function".   You
                     can  search for a maximum of 10 different patterns.
                     Remember the  expression,  case,  and  token  flags
                     apply to all of the search patterns. 

        Replace    - The  Replace  Pattern  is  the  "thing" you want in
        Pattern(s)   place of  the  Search  Pattern.    Like  the Search
                     Pattern,  you  can have up to 10 different patterns
                     separated by the  "|"  character.    YOU  MUST HAVE
                     EXACTLY  THE  SAME  NUMBER  OF  REPLACE PATTERNS AS
                     SEARCH  PATTERNS.    Actually,  you  can  also have
                     either   zero  or  one  Replace  Pattern,  but  not
                     anything between  one  and  the  number  of  Search
                     Patterns.    For example, three Search Patterns and
                     two Replace Patterns are  not  allowed,  but  three
                     Search  Patterns  and one or three Replace Patterns
                     are allowed.  If no Replace Pattern is  given, then
                     the  Search  Pattern,  when found, will be deleted.
                     If you have multiple Search Patterns and  only  one
                     Replace  Pattern,  all  the Search Patterns will be
                     replaced with the same thing.  The  example  at the
                     end  of  the Search and Replace Command help should


                                    Page 71





                     clarify these ideas. 

        Verify     - If you wish to make sure each Search Pattern  found
        Each         is  one  you  wish  to  replace  with  the  Replace
        Replace      Pattern, set this prompt to "Y".    If  you  do set
                     this  prompt  to  "Y",  you will have the following
                     options  whenever  a   Search   Pattern   is found:
                     Replace,  No  Replace,  Verify  Off, Enter Pattern,
                     Last Replace, and Quit.  If you select  "N"  at the
                     Verify prompt, replacements will be made until your
                     Search  Patterns  are  no  longer  found or you are
                     limited by your Replace Count (see below). 

        Smart      - If  you  set  Smart  Replace  to  "Y",  then   each
        Replace      replacement  will  have the same case as what it is
                     replacing.    For  example,  if  you  are replacing
                     "people"   with   "they"   and  "people"  begins  a
                     sentence, then if this prompt is set  to  "Y",  you
                     will  now  begin  the  sentence with "They".  Note:
                     Smart Replace only works with single word patterns. 

        Replace    - If you wish to limit the number of times  you  look
        Count        for  a Search Pattern then simply enter that number
                     here.  If you want to replace two of the  next five
                     "Zipkas" in your file with "Nonkas", then enter "5"
                     here   and   choose   Replace  or  No  Replace,  as
                     appropriate, at the Replace prompt.

        Note:        If  you are working with a file list and the search
                     pattern is not contained in the current file,  then
                     any  active  files  that follow the current file in
                     the file list (for a forward search) will  also  be
                     searched.  If you wish to confine the search to the
                     current file, then invoke File Select Mode ( <Shift
                     F2> ) and press <Ctrl U> so as to "untag" the other
                     files  in  the list.  Then press <Esc> to exit from
                     File Select Mode.  Refer  to  the  instructions and
                     help in File Select Mode for additional guidance. 

                     If  your  search  brings you to the end of the file
                     list and no more search patterns  are  found,  then
                     you  will  be  put  into  the  last file in which a
                     pattern had been found.

                                  Search Menu


        Browse     - Browse searches a list of files with  one  or  more
                     search  patterns.    Whenever  a  search pattern is
                     found, the line  containing  the  pattern  and  the
                     specified  number of context lines before and after
                     it will be  displayed.    You  have  the  option of
                     creating  a  file  list  instead  of displaying the
                     lines found.  A file list is a file  which contains
                     the names of other files.  A file list created with
                     Browse  contains the names of all the files with at
                     least one  occurrence  of  the  search  pattern  or
                     patterns.    You have the option to send the output
                     to the screen only or to both the  screen  and  the
                     current window. 

        Forward    - To  find  a  word,  line, or phrase located further
        Search       along  in  the  current  window  than  the   cursor
                     position,  use  Forward Search.  You can also press
                     <F10> to access Forward Search. 

        Backward   - To find a word, line, or phrase located before  the
        Search       cursor position in the current window, use Backward
                     Search.  You can also press <F9> to access Backward
                     Search. 

        Replace    - To find and replace a word, line, or phrase located
        Forward      further along in the current window than the cursor
                     position,  use Replace Forward.  You can also press
                     <Shift F10> to access Replace Forward. 

        Replace    - To find and replace a word, line, or phrase located
        Backward     before the cursor position in the  current  window,
                     use  Replace  Backward.   You can also press <Shift
                     F9> to access Replace Backward. 

        Search     - To repeat the last Search  or  Search  and  Replace
        Again        command, select Search Again or press <Ctrl G> (for
                     aGain).  

        Token      - To  use  Token  Match, set the cursor on one of the
        Match        tokens, select Token Match or press <Ctrl  T>,  and
                     Mr.  ED will find its match.  A token in this sense
                     is a word or set of characters  that  have  another
                     word or set of characters that always correspond to
                     it.    Token rules are set in the Environment Menu.
                     If no partner is defined for the word you  are  on,
                     Mr.  ED will find the next occurrence of that word.
                     Refer to  the  Token  Match  help,  for  additional
                     information  on defining and using tokens and Token
                     Match.

                                  Select Mode

             Select Mode allows you to select and work with a stream  of
        text.    Enter  Select  Mode by pressing <Ctrl S>.  The text you
        select becomes highlighted as you work.   The  beginning  of the
        stream  of  text is anchored at the place you originally pressed
        <Ctrl S> (see <Ctrl J>  below  on  how  to  change  that).   The
        following commands are active within Select Mode: 




      Lft,Rgt,Up,Dn      Move cursor and highlight more text.
      PgUp,PgDn          Move cursor and highlight one page up or down.
      Home,End           Highlight to beginning or end of row.
      Ctrl Home/End      Highlight to beginning or end of the file.
      Ctrl C             Use Condensed Mode to move cursor and highlight.
      Ctrl F             Highlight to beginning of first word on line.
      Ctrl J             Jump to opposite end of highlighted text.

                              Select Mode Commands

        A - Adjust  modifies  the  indentation  of  the  lines that were
            selected.  The indentation is adjusted  by  using  the arrow
            keys.    The left arrow key moves all of the lines one space
            to the left and the right arrow key indents all of the lines
            one  space  to  the  right.      Or   press   <L>   for left
            justification. 

        C - Copy  is used to copy the text to the "select buffer".  Once
            the text is copied you can use the <F2> key to paste it.   A
            copy  of the text stays in the "select buffer" until you put
            new text in it.  This means you  can  insert  the  same text
            multiple times using <F2>. 

        D - Delete  +  Copy  is  used  to delete the selected text while
            simultaneously copying it to the "select buffer".   Once the
            text  is deleted you can use the <F2> key to paste it at the
            cursor. 

        F - File List lets you construct your own "file  list".    It is
            assumed  that the text lines that have been selected consist
            of a valid path name (optional) and a  list  of  valid  file
            names   or  file  masks.    After  the  new  "file  list" is
            constructed, Mr. ED will attempt to load the first  file  in
            the list. 

        K - Delete  + No Copy (or Kill) deletes the text without copying
            it to the "select buffer".  This is very convenient when you
            wish to delete several lines but also preserve the  contents
            of the "select buffer". 

        L - Lightning Spell Check allows you to use Borland Inc.'s Turbo
            Lightning  Spell Checker on the selected text.  Before using
            Lightning Spell Check, Turbo Lightning must be activated  by
            being  loaded  into  memory.    (Actually,  it must first be
            purchased from Borland.) DO NOT LOAD  TURBO  LIGHTNING  FROM
            WITHIN  MR.  ED  (using  OS  Shell  or  OS  Command).  Turbo
            Lightning  is  memory  resident;  memory  resident  programs
            loaded  into  memory  while within another program can cause
            unexpected results -- like the inability to save your files.
            When loaded properly, Turbo Lightning acts just like  it  is
            part  of  Mr.  ED.  Turbo Lightning is copyright (C) Borland
            Inc., Scotts Valley, California. 

        M - Modify allows you to modify the text that has been selected.
            At the Modify prompt there are options to fill the  Selected
            Text  with  a  character,  convert  all of the characters to
            lower case, convert all of the characters to upper case,  or
            to switch the case of all of the characters. 

        P - Print  allows  you to print the selected lines of text.  The
            lines will be "printed to" the device that is  specified  in
            the  Environment  Menu.  For one printing you can change the
            print device from within this command.  You can also specify
            the printer left margin and page size at this prompt and the


                                    Page 76





            default within the Environment Menu. 

        S - Save File is used to save the selected lines of  text  to  a
            file. 

        Ctrl P - Paragraph  Format  allows  you  to  format  all  of the
            paragraphs within the selected text according to the margins
            and   indentation   specified   in   the   Environment Menu.
            Paragraphs  must  be  separated  by one or more blank lines.
            Paragraph Format can be used on any single paragraph without
            first selecting the text.  Just  place  the  cursor anywhere
            within  the  paragraph  to  be  formated and press <Ctrl P>.
            Voila, your paragraph is formatted. 

        + - Append to buffer allows you to add the selected text to  the
            end  of  the "select buffer".  There is an additional prompt
            for the Append command where you can append a  copy  of  the
            text  to  the buffer, delete the text plus append it, delete
            the text without appending it, or turn off  the  append  and
            return to the Select Mode prompt. 

            Be  forewarned:    This  command  can  not  append  texts of
            differing widths.

                                   Set Marker




             Markers are used to mark a specific location in  your file.
        Each  window  has  a  different  set of markers.  After pressing
        <Shift F8> or selecting Set Marker, press the letter, A,  B,  C,
        or  D,  corresponding to the marker you wish to set.  If you hit
        <Enter> without entering  a  marker,  then  the  next  available
        marker  will be set for your current location.  If you are using
        file lists you can set markers in different files. 

             You can move to a marker  using  Goto  Line  or  Marker  by
        pressing <Shift F7> or by selecting Goto Line/Marker on the Goto
        pulldown menu.

                           Temporary Replace Pattern




             If,   for  this  one  replace,  you  wish  to  replace  the
        highlighted text with a pattern other than the Replace  Pattern,
        enter  the  temporary  replace  pattern  here.   If no temporary
        replace pattern is given, then  the  highlighted  text  will  be
        deleted.    Remember, you can use "\n" and "\r" at the beginning
        or end of your temporary replace pattern to represent a carriage
        return.

                                  Token Match

             A token is a set of characters that  have  another  set  of
        characters that always correspond to it.  For example, in Pascal
        if  you  have  a "Begin" token, then you must also have an "End"
        token.  Listed below are the characters used in Token  Match and
        an explanation of how they are used. 





           Character                   Rule
               -           Separates comment partners.
               =           Separates all other partners.
               ;           Separates sets of partners from other sets.
               |           Separates multiple partners.





             For  example,  if  the  token  match  rules  are  given  by
        "(*-*);BEGIN|CASE=END" then the match to (* is *), the match  to
        BEGIN is END, and the match to CASE is END.  Mr. ED uses the "-"
        character  to  tell  what  are comments so that you can turn the
        nesting of comments off and on.  In  addition,  if  other tokens
        are  within a commented section, Mr. ED will skip them entirely.
        Mr. ED always allows the nesting of tokens if you have separated
        the parts with the "=" character.  You may have up  to  two "="s
        in   a   set.      For   example,   if  a  Token  Match  rule is
        "IF=ELSE=ENDIF", then Mr. ED will find all of the ELSE's in  the
        IF  statement  before it finds the ENDIF.  Tokens are set in the
        Environment Menu.  To use Token Match, set the cursor on  one of
        the  tokens, press <Ctrl T>, and Mr. ED will find its match.  If
        no partner is defined for the word you are on, Mr. ED will  find
        the next occurrence of that word.

                                  Window Menu


        Drop   - Drop  allows  you to drop one or more windows.  You are
                 prompted for the window number to remove.   The windows
                 are  numbered  from  1  to  9, and the window number is
                 indicated in the left most  portion  of  that  window's
                 status  line.    To drop multiple windows just separate
                 the window numbers with a comma or dash.   For example,
                 "1,3-5" will drop windows 1 and 3 through 5.  If any of
                 the  files  to  be  dropped  have been modified and are
                 unsaved, you will have the opportunity to save them. 

        Goto   - Goto allows you to move easily between different  files
                 in  different  windows.   Move the highlight bar to the
                 name of the file you wish to move to and press <Enter>.
                 The Goto menu will  show  you  which  files  have  been
                 modified  as  well  as  which are hidden.  You can also
                 access Goto by pressing <Alt 0>. 

        Hide   - Hide  allows  you  to  remove   a   window temporarily.
                 Movement  commands  like <Ctrl PgUp> and <Ctrl PgDn> as
                 well as commands that link windows together  like  Link
                 and  Compare Modes will ignore windows that are hidden.
                 To get back into windows that have been hidden, use the
                 Goto command ( <Alt 0> ).  You can also access  Hide by
                 pressing <Ctrl H>. 

        Insert - Insert allows you to insert additional windows into Mr.
                 ED.    There  can  be  a maximum of nine windows.  Each
                 window can have a different file or file list. 

        Next   - Next will move you  from  the  current  window  to  the
                 window  with the "next" window number.  That is, if you
                 are in window 2 and select Next, you will be  moved  to
                 window  3.  Next ignores windows that are hidden and if
                 you are in the "last" open window, Next will  move  you
                 to  the first open window.  You can also access Next by
                 pressing <Ctrl PgDn>. 

        Prev   - Previous is like Next except you move in  the  opposite
                 direction.    Previous moves you to the, well, previous
                 window.    Also  like  Next,  Previous   ignores hidden
                 windows and will wrap from the first open window to the
                 last  open window.  You can access Previous by pressing
                 <Ctrl PgUp>. 

        Style  - There are three multiple  window  screen  styles,  full
                 screen  and  split  horizontally  or vertically.  Style
                 changes the screen between these three styles.  When in
                 one of the two split styles, you can press <Ctrl Up> or
                 <Ctrl Dn> to change the window sizing.  Style  can also
                 be accessed by pressing <Ctrl N> (for next style).

        Zoom   - When  you  have  multiple windows with the screen split
                 horizontally or vertically, Zoom immediately makes  the
                 current  window  a  full screen window.  Selecting Zoom
                 again will return you to the  split  screen  style  you
                 were  in,  including  the  window  sizing  you  had  so
                 carefully  arranged.    You  can  also  access  Zoom by
                 pressing <Ctrl Z>.

                                    GLOSSARY


             Obviously the goal of any software should be to make things
        as  simple  and  clear as possible, while making the software as
        powerful as possible.  Just as obviously (maybe more obviously),
        this is not always the case.  So for those of  you  who  are not
        clairvoyant  or are wondering if "select buffer" is some kind of
        car  wax  mitt  or  heavy  duty  make-up  applicator,  here  are
        definitions for some of Mr. ED's less obvious terms. 



        Current - The  current  window  is the window with the cursor in
        Window    it.  If there is only one window then by  default that
                  is  the current window.  If you are in Command Mode or
                  the pulldown menus, the current window is  the  window
                  you  were  just  in.    (When  in  Command Mode or the
                  pulldown menus, a copy of the cursor will stay in  the
                  current  window,  but will look slightly modified.) To
                  change the current window, that is to move the  cursor
                  to  a  different  window,  press  <Ctrl PgUp> or <Ctrl
                  PgDn>.  In addition, you can use the <Alt  0>  or <Alt
                  1> through <Alt 9> keys.   Or  you  can  use  the Goto
                  command  from Command Mode or from the Window pulldown
                  menu.  Remember, the window number  is  on  the status
                  line in the upper left hand corner of your screen. 



        Scratch - When working with a file in Mr. ED, you are not really
        File      working with that file.  You are really working with a
                  copy  of  that file, called a scratch file.  Your file
                  is not modified until you save  the  scratch  file  to
                  your file name.  This means if you really mess up your
                  file,  you can reload a version of it without the mess
                  (or any of your other  changes  made  since  you  last
                  changed it). 



        ?=More  - The ?=More advice shows up on the far right of prompts
                  that  have  more  options than fit on one "promptful".
                  If you press the <?> key (the <Shift />  key  for  you
                  non-typists) when one of these prompts is showing, you
                  will  be shown additional options on a similar prompt.
                  Please note that you do not need to  make  the  option
                  you want show up on the prompt in order to use it; you
                  can select an option whether that option is showing on
                  the prompt or not.  For example, when in Select Mode (
                  <Ctrl  S>  ),  the  P=Print  option  is  on the second
                  prompt, but you can  still  press  <P>  at  the  first
                  prompt and your highlighted text will print. 





                                    Page 83





        Select  - Select  Buffer  is  a  place  in the computer's memory
        Buffer    where your highlighted text  is  placed  when  copying
                  from  Select  or  Block Mode.  Use the <F2> key to put
                  the text back into your file at  the  cursor position.
                  A  copy of the text will stay in memory until you copy
                  something else into memory using Select or Block Mode. 



        Command - You are in Command Mode when a long prompt shows up at
        Mode      the bottom of the  screen,  just  above  "Shift  F1  -
                  Help",  after  you  press the <Esc> key.  Command Mode
                  allows you to execute several file and window commands
                  with only two strokes (<Esc> and the first  letter  of
                  the  command).   If, when you press the <Esc> key, you
                  get a list of categories across the top of your screen
                  instead of the Command Mode prompt at the bottom, then
                  you are in Pulldown Menus Mode.   To  get  the Command
                  Mode prompt instead of the Pulldown Menus, go into the
                  Environment  (under  Layout),  and  change the "Enable
                  Pulldown Menus" prompt to "N".  Be sure to press <Ctrl
                  Enter>, or <Enter> at the final  prompt  of  the  last
                  page  of  the  Environment,  to  keep the change.  The
                  advantage of using Command Mode  versus  the  Pulldown
                  Menus  is  that Command Mode requires fewer keystrokes
                  to execute a command  than  the  Pulldown  Menus.   Of
                  course,  until  you become familiar with Mr. ED, using
                  the Pulldown Menus is  a  helpful  way  to  learn  and
                  access all of the features. 



        Status  - The Status Line is the line at the top of each window.
        Line      Each  Status  Line, amazingly enough, shows the status
                  of its window.  Listed below is a description  of each
                  item,  from  left  to  right,  contained on the Status
                  Line. 

          1         - The window number (1-9) of that Status Line.
          Eof:      - The number of lines in the file.
          Line:     - The line number the cursor is currently on.
          Col:      - The column number the cursor is currently in.
          Insert/   - The current status of the Insert/Overlay Mode.
          Overlay     When in Insert Mode, words already on a line will
                      scoot to the right when you type in front of them.
                      When in Overlay Mode, nothing scoots and you type
                      over anything currently there.  Use the <Ins> key
                      to switch between modes.
          (diamond) - A diamond before the path means the file has been
                      modified since it was last saved.
          path\     - This is the name and path of the file currently
          filename    in the window.
          (*)       - A "*" at the far right of the Status Line means
                      that you are using a file list with that window.

                              <Shift F1>.
          Dn or Up           - The direction of the last search or replace.
          AI                - Auto Indent mode is on ( <Ctrl I> ).
          WW                - Word Wrap is on ( <Ctrl W> ).

                               HELP FOR MESSAGES





             There  are some messages and errors to help guide you while
        you are  using  Mister  ED.    If  you  encounter  any  of these
        messages,  refer  to the following pages for further explanation
        on any that you might need help  on.    Each  will  describe the
        message in more detail, what you might have done to receive that
        message, and ways to remedy the problem. 

             In  the context of some of the messages, there will be text
        in angle brackets like  this:    <text>.    This  text will vary
        depending on the context of the message. 



        COMMAND LINE ERRORS

        Not enough memory to run Mister ED
             You  do  not  have enough free memory to run Mister ED.  If
        you are running on a network, the network software  often  takes
        up a lot of memory.  Or, you might have too many memory resident
        programs installed.  Try running locally or removing some of the
        memory resident programs. 

        Unknown command line parameter:  <Entry>
             You  have  entered  a command line parameter that Mister ED
        does not recognize.  The valid parameters include: 

             -I<Path>  Include  a  new   source  file  path  for  multi-
                       directory editing.

             -L25      This puts the screen into 25 line mode.
             -L43      If  you  have  an  EGA card, this puts the screen
                       into 43 line mode.
             -L50      If you have a VGA card, this puts the screen into
                       50 line mode.
             -L        Flips the current mode (if you  are  in  25  line
                       mode,  this  puts  the  screen into 43 or 50 line
                       mode, or vice versa).

        Unknown command line parameter option
             You have entered a command line parameter with an incorrect
        option.  Invalid cases include:  1) -I with  a  space or nothing
        following  it.  You need to enter the path immediately following
        the "I".   2)  -L  with  an  incorrect  value  like  "32".  (See
        "Unknown  command line parameter" message help for a list of all
        valid options)

        COMPARE MODE ERRORS

        The file compare has been interrupted
             You pressed <Esc> and interrupted the file compare.  If you
        wish to stop the comparison, press  <Esc>  again.    To continue
        with the compare, press <Enter>. 

        The files compare but are different sizes
             All  of  the  information in the files that you compared is
        the same, but you reached the end of one of the  files  and  the
        other file contains more lines. 

        The following lines do not compare
             The  lines that are highlighted by Mister ED do not compare
        exactly.  If you wish to continue, press  <Ctrl  Enter>  to move
        the  highlight  bar  down  one line and restart the compare.  To
        exit Compare mode, press <Esc>. 

        Unable to find current line in other files
             You pressed <Ctrl S> to attempt to find the  cursored  line
        in your other files, but Mister ED is unable to find the current
        line in one of your other files. 


        DATA ENTRY ERRORS

        Enter some data
             This  command  requires  that  you  enter  some data before
        continuing.    Enter  your  information  and  press   <Enter> to
        continue. 

        Invalid drop specification
             You  have  made an error in specifying the window number(s)
        to be dropped.  The following are examples of valid entries:  1;
        1,2; 1-3; 3-; 2,4-7. 

        Invalid file extension entered
             Mister  ED's  file  extensions  cannot  be  longer  than  3
        characters.  Also, you cannot enter more than one "|" in a row. 

        Invalid file name
             Mister  ED's file names cannot be longer than 8 characters,
        and file extensions cannot be longer than  3  characters.   They
        can  include  letters,  numbers, and special characters (Consult
        your DOS manual for which special characters you may use). 

        Messages will be displayed for this long
             Any information that you need to know, aside  from  errors,
        Mister ED will display on the bottom of the screen.  You may set
        the length of time you wish these messages to display.  Any time
        you  change the time interval, the above message will appear for
        the amount of time you have specified.

        Not a valid command
             The command you entered is not a valid  Mister  ED command.
        Please  try  another command.  If you need further help, consult
        Mister ED's On-line Help for the desired operation you  wish  to
        perform. 

        Number out of range
             The  number  you  entered is not within the valid range for
        this command.  Check the range of values again and enter another
        number.  If you  need  further  help  with  valid  data  for the
        command, consult Mister ED's On-Line Help or Manual. 


        DOS DISK ERRORS

        Access to this file is denied
             This  file cannot be accessed because it could be locked by
        another program or could be loaded from a network and in use  by
        another person. 

        Disk Read/Write error (CRC data error)
             This  error  happens  when  the floppy disk cannot be read.
        The usual cause for this problem is writing to the disk  in  low
        density  when using a high density drive, then trying to read it
        on a different low density drive. 

        File does not exist
             You have specified a  file  that  does  not  exist  on  the
        current  path,  or  you have spelled the file name wrong.  Enter
        the directory path along with  the  file  name  or  reenter  the
        correct file name. 

        Invalid drive specified
             The  drive  you  specified  is  not currently valid on your
        system.  Please enter another drive letter. 

        Low level DOS file manager error <error number>
             You have encountered a DOS disk  error.    For  help, check
        your  DOS  technical  manual  for  the error number or call your
        computer dealer. 

        Path does not exist
             The directory path  you  entered  does  not  exist  on  the
        specified disk drive.  Please reenter the path. 

        The disk drive door is open
             The disk drive door is open.  Please insert diskette, close
        the drive door and try again. 

        The diskette is write protected
             Mister  ED  cannot write to the diskette because there is a
        write protect tab on the diskette.  Please  remove  the  tab and
        try again. 




                                    Page 88





        The file is a <Read-Only or Hidden> file; Continue?
             You  are  attempting  to  write  over a Read-Only or Hidden
        file.  If you  continue,  Mister  ED  will  overwrite  the file,
        although  it  will  keep  the  same attributes that the file had
        previously. 


        DOS ERRORS

        DOS memory error <error number>
             You have encountered a DOS memory error.   For  help, check
        your  DOS  technical  manual  for  the error number or call your
        computer dealer. 

        Too many open files (no handles left)
             You are trying  to  open  more  files  than  your  system's
        configuration  can  handle  at  this  time.    To alleviate this
        problem for now and in the  future,  add  these  lines  to  your
        CONFIG.SYS:    FILES=20;  BUFFERS=10.    Once you've added these
        lines, reboot your system to include this new configuration. 


        FILE LIST ERRORS

        Building the file list has been aborted
             You were  either  loading  "*.*"  or  "@FILE.LST"  and  you
        pressed  <Esc>  which  stopped  Mister ED from building the file
        list.  Although the build was not  completed,  the  part  of the
        file  list  that  was  created up to the point you pressed <Esc>
        will be kept. 

        End of file list
             When you use a wildcard to load a group of files,  or  load
        an  external  file list, they are loaded in a certain order.  By
        toggling through with <Ctrl +> or <Ctrl ->, you have reached the
        Last or the First file, respectively, of the file list. 

        Not enough memory to load complete file list
             The file list that you wish to  load  is  larger  than  the
        memory  you  have  set  aside  for it.  On the third page of the
        Environment menu, there is an option you can set called  "Number
        of  K  for  file  list  [1-64]".    This  option  sets aside the
        specified amount of memory specifically for loading  file  lists
        into  it.  First, set the Environment menu amount higher and try
        loading the list again.  If this  doesn't  work,  you  might try
        breaking  your  list  down  and  making it smaller.  Each window
        containing a file list  also  takes  up  extra  memory,  so  try
        closing some windows before loading the list.

        INTERNAL ERRORS (CRITICAL ERRORS)

        Edit block records exhausted (Call Cornerstone Systems)
             Normally,  you  should  not  get this internal error.  This
        basically means "Mister  ED  is  out  to  lunch".    Please call
        Cornerstone Systems and report the error. 

        Problem:  Stack Overflow; <Enter> to Continue
             You  have performed a combination of steps that have caused
        the program stack to overflow.  Try to remember  what  steps you
        have  just taken and make a note of them.  Then, save your file,
        if you can.  When saving, use a different name because  the file
        you  were editing may be corrupt and you don't want to overwrite
        the good version you had before getting this error.  After that,
        please call Cornerstone Systems and report the error. 

        Unexpected end of file (Call Cornerstone Systems)
             Normally, you should not get  this  internal  error.   This
        basically  means  "Mister  ED  is  out  to  lunch".  Please call
        Cornerstone Systems and report the error. 


        MACRO ERRORS

        <macro name> is already defined
             The macro key you  have  chosen  already  exists.    If you
        continue, you will overwrite the previously created macro. 

        About to cancel recording of a macro
             You  were  recording  a  macro  and  have  chosen "Quit and
        erase...".  This choice will take you out  of  macros  and erase
        any keystrokes you have recorded. 

        No macros are defined
             You  have not yet loaded in the macro file, or you have not
        recorded any macros recently.  Press Alt=  and  choose "Load..."
        or "Record...". 

        The macro file has been altered; Are you sure?
             You  have  tried to load the macro file from disk, but have
        recently recorded a macro without saving the  macro  file first.
        If you load the file, any recently recorded macros will be lost. 

        The macro file has not been saved; Save it?
             You  have  recorded  at least one macro in this session and
        have chosen to exit without  saving  what  you  have  previously
        recorded.  Press <Enter> to save the macros you have recorded. 

        The macro file is not compatible
             You  are  attempting  to use an older version of macro file
        that is not compatible with this version of Mister ED. 

        Unable to save the macro file:  <macro name>
             You are unable to save the macro file because the  disk  is
        full, write protected, or there is a disk error. 


                                    Page 90






        You cannot assign a macro to this key
             You   cannot   assign  macros  to  the  following  keys/key
        combinations because they have special functions  in  Mister ED:
        Esc,  Carriage  Return, Line Feed, <Ctrl J>, <Ctrl M>, and <Ctrl
        Z>. 


        PRINTER ERRORS

        Invalid printer port specified
             An invalid printer port  was  specified  for  the  "Default
        Printer  Port" on the Environment menu or the "Printer Port" for
        the Print command.  Valid  printer  ports  include:   PRN, LPT#,
        COM#,  or  any common DOS port.  Invalid ports include:  A file,
        the  screen,  or  any  LPT#  or  COM#  higher  than  the  number
        configured on your system. 

        The printer is not ready
             Mister  ED  cannot  output  to  this  printer because it is
        off-line.  Turn the printer back on-line and try printing again. 

        The printer is not responding
             The  printer  you  are  outputting  to  is  not  responding
        correctly  to  Mister  ED's  signals.   This might mean that the
        printer is not hooked up  properly,  or  that  it's  turned off.
        Another problem could be that it has run out of paper. 


        PROGRAM EXECUTION ERRORS

        <\path\file name> already exists
             The file name you are attempting to save to already exists.
        If  you wish to overwrite what's on disk, then continue.  If you
        wish to create a new file, then press Esc and enter a  new  file
        name. 

        Cannot find <program name>
             You  are  attempting  to  perform  a DOS command, run a DOS
        program in Mister ED, or are trying to load  the  OS  Shell  and
        Mister ED cannot find the program. 

        File not saved
             You pressed <Esc> and aborted overwriting an existing file.
        There  may  have  also  been  an  error while a backup was being
        created, or you might not have access to a Read-Only file. 

        Incompatible block types -- Unable to Append
             You have attempted to Append to the select buffer, but  the
        block  types  do  not match.  You cannot append text selected by
        the "Block" command to text selected by the "Select" command and
        vice versa.  If you are attempting  to  append  "Block"  text to
        "Block" text, you must make sure that it is the same size width.

        Keep the new Dos directory?
             You  have  changed  your default data directory.  Mister ED
        wants to know if you wish to keep the new directory or return to
        your previous one. 

        Not enough memory to load <program name>
             You are attempting to perform a  DOS  command,  run  a  DOS
        program  in  Mister  ED,  or are trying to load the OS Shell and
        there is not enough room for Mister ED to load the program. 

        The file cannot exceed 64000 lines
             There cannot be more than 64000 lines of text contained  in
        one  file.    You may also be attempting to load a file that has
        more than 64000 lines in it.  You might try  splitting  the file
        and editing smaller portions. 

        The help file is not available
             Mister ED cannot find the help file in any of the following
        paths:    The  current  directory  (where  you started Mister ED
        from), "Path  for  support  files:"  found  on  Page  3  of  the
        Environment  menu,  the  program  directory  (where  Mister ED's
        program files are), or in the DOS path. 

        The help file is not compatible
             You are attempting to use an older version of  Mister  ED's
        help  file  and it is not compatible with this version of Mister
        ED.  Make sure that you  copied  the  help  that  came  with the
        version of Mister ED that you are using. 

        The line cannot exceed 255 characters
             The  maximum  number of characters you may have in one line
        of text is 255.  This may include spaces, letters,  numbers, and
        special characters. 

        The line concatenation cannot exceed 255 characters
             You  have  used  <F6>  to  delete  the end of a line.  This
        operation has moved the text up from the next line and  appended
        it  to  the  end  of  the  current  line.  The concatenation has
        exceeded the line maximum of  255  characters.    This  may also
        happen if you used <F5> to delete to the beginning of a line. 

        This is an invalid command for an unmodifiable file
             You  have attempted to alter a file that you loaded in with
        the Modify option set to "No".    The  invalid commands include:
        1) OS Command with the output directed to the current window; 2)
        Append  command  which  would  append information to the current
        file; 3) Browse mode option to echo lines found to  the  current
        window. 

        This is an invalid command while Memory Resident
             The  following  commands  are  invalid  while  Mister ED is
        memory resident:  "OS Shell" and  "OS  Command".   These options
        cannot   be   used  because  they  both  need  to  load  another
        COMMAND.COM which is not possible while running Mister ED  as  a
        memory resident program.

        Unable to create backup file
             The  backup file is unable to be created because an invalid
        drive is specified for "Backup Directory:"  on  the  Environment
        menu.  There may also be a physical problem with the disk. 

        Unable to save environment to code file
             The  Environment  file  is  saved back to the program file.
        You need to make sure  that  the  "Program  to  Update"  on  the
        Environment  menu  is  set  to  the  correct  path  and  program
        (ED.EXE).  If you are running on a network, you  might  not have
        write access to the disk. 

        You cannot insert more than 9 windows
             No  more  windows  can be inserted because you already have
        the maximum of 9 windows open. 


        SEARCH AND REPLACE ERRORS

        Carriage Return found in pattern
             There was a Carriage  Return  placed  incorrectly  in  your
        Search  or Replace pattern.  They can be at the beginning or end
        of your pattern but may not be in the middle of it. 

        Invalid "@", "+", or "*" found in search pattern
             You have incorrectly entered one or more of  the  following
        symbols:    @,  +,  *.    You may not enter two of these symbols
        together, enter them immediately following a %, |,  or  Carriage
        Return, or enter them as the first character inside parentheses. 

        Invalid character found after "\"
             There  was  an invalid <Esc> code found after the "\".  You
        might have entered a "\" at the  end  of  a  line  with  nothing
        following it, or entered "\x" for a hex number and not entered a
        value.    See  the  manual or Mister ED's on-line help for valid
        sequences. 

        Invalid number of replace patterns
             The number of Replace patterns entered is not valid for the
        number of Search patterns entered.  You may have an equal number
        of Search and Replace patterns, or you may only have one Replace
        pattern with multiple Search  patterns.    You  cannot, however,
        have  between  one  and the number of Search patterns or greater
        than the number of Search patterns. 

        Invalid range found within "[]"
             You have entered an invalid range within a  set.    A valid
        range  is  "a-z".  Invalid range examples include:  a-, -z, z-a.
        The range "z-a" is invalid because ranges must always be entered
        in ascending order (from the smallest to the largest value). 






                                    Page 93





        Invalid set "[]" found in search pattern
             You have  entered  an  invalid  set  ([])  for  the  Search
        pattern.   The following are cases of invalid sets:  [] = empty;
        more than 20 sets; [~] = ~ by itself (~  =  not);  missing  "]";
        [invalid characters] = Carriage Return, Line Feed, or an Invalid
        <Esc> (\) char. 

        Odd number of "()" in pattern
             You  have  entered  parentheses as part of your pattern and
        there are an uneven  number  of  them,  meaning  that  somewhere
        there's a "(" without a ")", or vice versa.  You might check for
        a pair of parentheses being separated by a "|". 

        Search pattern cannot be blank ("|" separates multiple patterns)
             Your  Search  pattern  cannot  be blank.  Remember that "|"
        separates multiple patterns, and you may have accidentally typed
        in two of them next to each other. 

        Search pattern not found
             Mister ED cannot find anymore occurrences of the  specified
        search pattern in the file or file list. 

        The  replacement  pattern  will  cause  the  line  to exceed 255
        characters
             The replacement pattern is longer than the  search pattern.
        The  longer pattern is causing the line to exceed the maximum of
        255 characters. 

        Too many patterns ("|" separates multiple patterns)
             You may only have a  maximum  of  10  patterns  for  either
        Search   or  Replace.    Remember  that  "|"  separates multiple
        patterns.  So, if you are using it as  part  of  your  Search or
        Replace pattern, you must precede it with a backslash (\). 


        SPELLING CHECK ERRORS

        Turbo Lightning is not installed in memory
             You  have  attempted  to use Turbo Lightning for a spelling
        check, but it is not available for use.  Turbo Lightning must be
        installed before using Mister  ED.    IMPORTANT:  You  must exit
        Mister  ED,  install Turbo Lightning, and then restart Mister ED
        again.  DO NOT install it from within Mister ED by using the "OS
        Shell" or the "OS Command" options. 

        Unable to find the Auxiliary Dictionary
             You attempted to add a word to Turbo Lightning's dictionary
        which changes its Auxiliary Dictionary and it is  unable  to  be
        found.    Exit Mister ED and make sure that the spell checker is
        configured correctly.   For  help,  check  your  Turbo Lightning
        manual.

        TOKEN MATCH ERRORS

        Bad token rule
             You have made an error when entering a token rule.  Invalid
        cases  include:  1) !=! - Both tokens are the same; 2) a=b=c=d -
        Greater than 2 "="s in a set (before a ";"); 3) a-b-c -  Greater
        than  1 "-" in a set; 4) ;; - Two ";"s together creating a blank
        set; 5) || - Two "|"s together  creating  a  blank  partner;  6)
        Including spaces or tabs is also invalid. 

        Cannot find the corresponding token
             Mister   ED  cannot  find  another  matching  word  or  the
        corresponding token that matches the token  your  cursor  is on.
        Check  the  token rules on the Environment menu to make sure you
        have the token defined.
