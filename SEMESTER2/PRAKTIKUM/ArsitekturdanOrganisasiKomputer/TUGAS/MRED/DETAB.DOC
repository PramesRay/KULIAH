	      Detab expands all the tabs in an ascii file to spaces
	 and oh boy is it fast!!

	      Detab can run in two modes, command line and prompt.  If
	 you leave the command line blank, you will be prompted for
	 the input and output filenames (they can be the same).  The
	 command line mode format is:

	      DETAB [ Input.fil [ Output.fil ] ]

	 Where Output.fil can be left off to put output into the
	 input.fil.  If Input.fil is left off you will be prompted for
	 the filenames.

	      Detab also accepts wild cards, for example DETAB *.PAS
	 will expand all the tabs in all the .Pas files in the current
	 directory.

	      Detab can also be run with redirection.  For example:

	      DETAB <Input.fil

	 would set the detabbed file onto the screen.  If Detab
	 determines that the input is being redirected the output will
	 be directed to the screen regardless of any other command
	 line parameters.

	      Some editors and other utilities do not use the Dos
	 standard of eight spaces per tab.  In order to get around
	 this limitation Detab has a command line switch (/nn).  This
	 switch tells Detab how many spaces to use per tab.  If the
	 switch is not specified the default is eight spaces per tab.
	 For example if a different editor put four spaces per tab and
	 you wanted to use Mister ED (which you now realize if far
	 superior), the following command will move you up in the
	 world:

	      DETAB Lesser.fil Better.fil /4
